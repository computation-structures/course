<h3>Introduction to Jade</h3>

<p>Jade (JAvascript Design Environment) supports schematic entry and
circuit simulation at both the device- and gate-level.  The basic
element of a Jade design is a named <i>module</i>, which can include
various <i>aspects</i>:

<ul>
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">schematic</span>: a graphical
representation of the module's circuit containing instances of other
other modules connected by wires.  Jade includes two libraries of
primitive modules: /analog, a set of device-level components supported
by device-level simulation, and /gates, a set of gate-level components
supported by gate-level simulation.  There are also some basic
built-in components: connections to ground and power, input/output
ports, jumpers, multi-port memories, and descriptive text.

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps">icon</span>: a graphical
representation for instances of this module appearing in the
schematics of other modules.  The icon can include lines, arcs, circles,
descriptive text, terminals, and a text rendering of the instance's
properties.  There should a terminal instance for each input/output connection;
the rest of the icon elements are purely decorative.

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps">properties</span>: a list
of key/value pairs providing useful information about the module.  Property
values can be set separately for each instance of the module and have a
default value if they have not been specified for a particular instance.
All modules have a "name" property, used to uniquely identify each
instance.  Other properties are used during simulation, e.g., the
Resistance property of the /analog/resistor module specifies the resistance
of this particular instance of the module.

<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps">test</span>: an optional unit test for
the module, which uses the simulator to verify the functionality of the module's
circuit.  The test can specify a timed sequence of input values and,
for each set of inputs, specify the expected output values.

</ul>

<p><b>Jade window</b>

<p>If enabled for this Jade instance, use the module selection box to choose which module to edit (or
double click the corresponding component in the parts bin).  The
module tools let you create a new module (<i class="fa fa-edit"></i>),
make a copy of the current module under a new name
(<i class="fa fa-copy"></i>), delete the current module
(<i class="fa fa-trash"></i>), save all the modules in the
browser's local storage (<i class="fa fa-download"></i>), or select previously
saved modules to load into the current workspace (<i class="fa fa-upload"></i>).

<p>The editor tabs select which aspect to edit --
the instructor chooses which tabs will be shown for each Jade instance.  The different
editors are described below.

<p>A status window for tool tips and error messages appears below the editor tabs.

<p><b>Schematics</b>

<p>Schematics are circuit diagrams containing components whose terminals are
connected by wires to the terminals of other components.  The schematic editor
has a toolbar at the top, with a schematic canvas below, and, on the right, a
parts bin of components available to be added the schematic.  The
instructor chooses which parts will appear in the parts bin for each Jade instance.

<p><i>Components:</i>

<ul>
<li> to <b>add</b> a component to the diagram, click on the component in the parts
bin and drag it into the schematic.

<p><li> click to <b>select</b> a component, shift-click to add or remove a component
from the current selection.  You can also click or shift-click on the schematic
background, then drag out a selection rectangle which will select any component
that intersects the rectangle.  You can use the editing tools on the left of
toolbar above the schemetic to manipulate the currently selected components:
<ul>
<p><li> <b>cut</b> (<i class="fa fa-cut"></i>) moves the selection from the schematic to the clipboard (or
type ctrl/cmd X).  Typing DEL will delete the current selection.
<p><li> <b>copy</b> (<i class="fa fa-copy"></i>) copies the selection to the clipboard, leaving the selected
components unchanged (or type ctrl/cmd C)
<p><li> <b>flip</b> the component horizontally (<i class="fa fa-arrows-h"></i>)
or vertically (<i class="fa fa-arrows-v"></i>),
or <b>rotate</b> (<i class="fa fa-rotate-left"></i>, <i class="fa fa-rotate-right"></i>)
in either direction by 90 degrees.
</ul>
<p>You can <b>paste</b> (<i class="fa fa-paste"></i>) the current contents of the clipboard into the schematic
(or type ctrl/cmd V).
<p>You can click-and-drag the current selection to <b>move</b> it.

<p><li> double-click a component to <b>edit its properties</b>.

<p><li>You can <b>undo</b> (<i class="fa fa-reply"></i>) or <b>redo</b>
(<i class="fa fa-share"></i>) an editing action.

</ul>
