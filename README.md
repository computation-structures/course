Computation Structures (6.004) is a sophomore-level subject offered by
the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
It's an introductory course about the design and implementation of
digital systems, emphasizing structural principles common to a wide
range of technologies.

Starting at the device level, the course develops a hierarchical set
of building blocks â€” logic gates, combinational and sequential
circuits, finite-state machines, processors and finally complete
systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a
series of design examples. The problem sets and lab exercises are
intended to give students hands-on experience in designing digital
systems; students complete the gate-level design for a RISC processor
during the lab exercises.

I was involved in teaching the subject from Fall 1995 through Spring 2018
to a total of 8647 registered students (about 25% of the undergraduates
attending MIT during that period).  This repo contains the course materials
I used in Spring 2018 including the lecture slides, edited transcripts
of the lectures, and the worksheets of past quiz problems that students
used to review their understanding of the material.  I hope this material
will be of use to students interested in how computers work and to my teaching
collegues who introduce those students to the digital world.

The course materials are the result of a collaborative effort by many
MIT colleagues.  Steve Ward was the originator of the course in the
early 1980's and in many ways what you see here is his brain child.
Other contributors over the years include Bert Halstead, Greg
Papadopoulos, Gill Pratt, Leonard McMillan, Silvina Hanono Wachman,
and Daniel Sanchez.

Enjoy!
