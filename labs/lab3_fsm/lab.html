      <h3>Problem 3.  Design problem: Well-formed parenthesis string checker</h3>

      <p>In 1936 Alan Turing described the "a-machine", a device that
        performed computations on a string of symbols according to a simple
        set of manipulation rules enumerated in the form of a finite-state
        machine (FSM).  The machine consisted of</p>

      <ul> ...an unlimited memory capacity obtained in the form of an
        infinite tape marked out into squares, on each of which a symbol could
        be printed. At any moment there is one symbol in the machine; it is
        called the scanned symbol. The machine can alter the scanned symbol
        and its behavior is in part determined by that symbol, but the symbols
        on the tape elsewhere do not affect the behavior of the
        machine. However, the tape can be moved back and forth through the
        machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the
        machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an
        innings.  (Turing, 1948)
      </ul>

      <p>We now refer to this device as a Turing Machine (TM) and use it as
        our definition for what it means to be computable, i.e., we believe
        (Church&#700;s Thesis) that a function is algorithmically computable if and
        only if it&#700;s computable by a TM.</p>

      <p>The goal of this lab is write the FSM controller for a TM that
        checks to see if the string of left and right parentheses it finds on
        its input tape "balance".</p>

      <p>The TM has a doubly-infinite tape with discrete symbol positions
        (cells) each of which contains one of a finite set of symbols.  The
        control FSM has one input: the symbol found in the current cell.  The
        FSM produces several outputs: the symbol to be written into the
        current cell and a motion control that determines how the head should
        move.  In our simulation, the tape is displayed horizontally, so the
        tape can move left, right, or stay where it is.</p>

      <p>The operation of the TM is specified by a file containing one or
        more of the following statements:</p>

      <p><tt>// <i>comment</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        C++-style comment: ignore characters starting with the "//" and
        continuing to the end of the current line.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>/* ... */</tt></p>
      <ul>
        C-style comment: ignore characters between "/*" and "*/".  Note that
        the ignored characters may include newlines; this type of comment can
        be used to comment-out multiple lines of your file.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>symbols <i>symbol...</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Declare one or more tape symbols.  The symbol "-" (dash) is predefined
        and is used to indicate that a tape cell is blank.  You have to
        declare symbols you use in an action statement (see below).  A symbol
        can be any sequence of non-whitespace characters not including "/", "\", or
        the quote character.  If you want to declare a symbol containing
        whitespace, "/" or quote, you must enclose the symbol in quotes.  You
        can have more than one <tt>symbols</tt> statement in your file.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>states <i>state...</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Declare one or more states.  There are two predefined states: "*halt*"
        and "*error*".  The TM simulation will stop if either of these states
        is reached.  The "*error*" state is useful for indicating that the TM
        has halted due to an unexpected condition.  You can have more than one
        <tt>states</tt> statement in your file.  The first state specified by
        the first <tt>states</tt> statement is the starting state for the TM.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>action <i>state symbol newstate writesymbol motion</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Specify the action performed by the TM when the current state
        is <tt><i>state</i></tt> and the current symbol
        is <tt><i>symbol</i></tt>.  First the TM will write <tt><i>writesymbol</i></tt> into
        the current cell of the tape.  Then the tape is moved left if "l" is
        specified for the <tt><i>motion</i></tt>, right if "r" is specified and remain where
        it is if "-" is specified.  Finally the current state of the control
        FSM is changed to <tt><i>newstate</i></tt> and the TM searches for the next applicable
        action.  If <tt><i>newstate</i></tt> is "*halt*" or "*error*", the TM simulation
        stops.  If there is no action specified for the current state and
        current symbol, the TM enters the "*error*" state.  Note that you have
        to declare any symbols or states you use in an <tt>action</tt>
        statement -- this requirement is helpful in catching typos.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>tape <i>name symbol...</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Specifies the initial configuration of a TM tape, each tape has a
        name.  The various names are displayed as a set of radio buttons at
        the bottom of the TM animation -- you can select which tape is loaded at
        reset by clicking on one of the buttons.  You can specify which cell
        of the tape is to be current cell after reset by enclosing the
        appropriate symbol in square brackets.  For example, an initial tape
        configuration called "test" consisting of three non-blank cells with
        the head positioned over the middle cell is specified by
        <pre>tape test 1 [2] 3</pre>
        If no initial head position is specified, the head is positioned over
        the leftmost symbol on the tape.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>result <i>name symbol...</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Specifies the expected head position and contents of the tape after
        the TM has finished processing the initial tape configuration called
        name.  This statement is used by the checkoff system to verify that
        your TM has correctly processed each of the test tapes.  Whenever the
        TM enters the "*halt*" state, the final tape configuration is checked
        against the appropriate result statement if one has been specified and
        any discrepancies will be reported in the status display at the bottom
        of the TMSim window.
      </ul>

      <p><tt>result1 <i>name symbol</i></tt></p>
      <ul>
        Like <tt>result</tt> except that only the current symbol is checked against the
        specified value.
      </ul>

      <p>Here&#700;s an example file that defines a control FSM with three
        states (s1, s2 and s3) and two possible tape symbols: "1" and "-"
        (recall that the "-" symbol is predefined).  There is a single tape
        configuration defined called "test" which consists of a blank tape.
        The final tape configuration is expected to be a tape containing six
        consecutive "1" symbols with the head positioned over the second "1".
        Note that there is an action declared for each possible combination of
        the three states and two tape symbols.</p>

      <p><pre class="jsim">// 3-state busy beaver Turing Machine example

      <p>You&#700;ll find an instance of TMSim, our TM simulator, at the bottom
        of this webpage.  Here&#700;s what the TM simulator
        looks like:</p>

      <p><center><img src="10.png" width="600" /></center></p>

      <p>The TM display consists of the following parts:</p>

      <ul>
        <p>
        <i>Simulator control:</i> The five buttons are, respectively:
        <ul>
          <li/> reset TM and tape to initial state;
          <li/> step back to previous state and tape configuration
          <li/> run the simulation for multiple steps
          <li/> halt a running simulation
          <li/> run the simulation for a single step
        </ul>
        The speed of the running machine is determined by the radio
        buttons on the right.</p>

        <p><i>State display:</i> shows the current tape contents, head
          position and current state of the controlling FSM.  The number of
          simulation steps is displayed on the left, just below the tape.  The
          next action to be performed, as determined by the current state and
          tape symbol, is highlighted in your design file.</p>

        <p><i>Test selection:</i> radio button to select which test
          tape to use.  A <button>Checkoff</button> will also be displayed.  Clicking on
          <button>Checkoff</button> will run all the test tapes and, if they
          all pass, you&#700;ll be able to submit your design file online.</p>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Well-formed parenthesis string checker</b></p>

      <p>Your task is to write the control FSM for a TM that determines if
        the parenthesis string on its input tape is balanced.  The initial position
        of the head will be at the leftmost non-blank symbol on the tape, i.e., at
        the left end of the parenthesis string. Your TM should
        halt with a current symbol of "1" if the parens balance, or a current
        symbol of "0" if the parens don&#700;t balance.  The head should be
        positioned over the "0" or "1" on the tape.  Note that there are no
        constraints on what the rest of the tape contains.</p>

      <p>NOTE: TMs that simply use some fixed number of states to count the
        number of unmatched open parentheses would not be able handle an
        arbitrary-length inputs and so do not qualify as acceptable solutions.
        The staff will check this constraint during the check-off meeting.</p>

      <p>Use the TMSim simulator below to enter your design in the "Paren
        Checker" tab.  The initial contents of the tab are a sequence of test
        tapes which must be processed successfully by your TM.  To run the tests,
        click "TMSim Assemble" and then "Checkoff".  If all the tests pass,
        then clicking <button>Check &amp; Save</button> will give you credit for completing
        this problem.  Please see the note on scoring at the end of this problem.</p>

      <p>Note that you&#700;re welcome to add your own test tapes while
        debugging your implementation, but you&#700;ll need to comment them out
        before running the checkoff tests (otherwise the checksum mechanism
        will get confused).</p>

      <p>Scoring: The number of points you&#700;ll receive at the Check-off
        meeting is determined by the number of states in your TM definition:</p>
      <ul>
        4 points: 2 states<br/>
        3 points: 3 states<br/>
        2 points: 4 states<br/>
        1 point: 5 or more states
      </ul>
      <p>"Counting" solutions do not receive any credit.</p>

      <h3>Problem 4. Design problem: Sequential Logic</h3>

      <p> Your task is to design a sequential logic circuit that
        implements the FSM shown in the state transition diagram below:</p>

      <p><center><img src="4_1.png" width="500" /></center></p>

      <p>The sequential circuit has three inputs:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><tt>CLK</tt>.  One rising clock edge the FSM should advance to
          the next state which is determined from current state, the RESET
          input and the <tt>IN</tt> input.</li>

        <li><tt>IN</tt>.  A simple binary input that determined which,
          along with the current state, selects which transition is chosen
          from the state transition diagram.</li>

        <li><tt>RESET</tt>. When 1 at the rising edge of CLK, the FSM
          should transition to the SA state regardless of the current state
          and value of <tt>IN</tt>.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In the test, the values of <tt>IN</tt> and <tt>RESET</tt> are
        provided 10ns before the rising edge of <tt>CLK</tt>, which should
        provide sufficient time for them to processed by logic or a ROM
        and influence the value for the next state.</p>

      <p>The values of the two outputs, <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt>, are
        determined by the current state and are as shown in the state
        transition diagram.</p>

      <p>The details of the implementation are up to you.  Of course,
        you&#700;ll need some number D registers to hold the current state.
        The next-state and output logic could be logic gates (see L06
        slides 23 and 24) or our "standard" ROM plus register setup (see
        L06 slide 11).</p>

      <p>The steps you&#700;ll need to follow to complete the design are
        outlined on slides 8 and 9 of L06.  See the diagram on slide 11 of
        L06 for one way to handle setting an initial state during reset.</p>

      <div class="hint">
        <p>
          The Memory component can be used to build a read-only memory
          (ROM).  You can insert a memory component into your schematic by
          clicking on the "MEM" icon in the schematic tab and dragging it
          onto the schematic.  Double-click the memory component to change
          its properties. Please the see documentation for the Memory
          component at the end of the
          <a href="/handouts/tool_docs/stdcell.html" target="_blank">Standard Cell Library</a>
          datasheet.</p>

        <p>To build a ROM, set the memory component to have a single
          port with the desired number of address inputs and data outputs.
          Connect its CLK and WE inputs to 0&#700;1, which will disable the
          ability to write into the memory, making it read-only.  And
          connect its OE input to 1&#700;1 which will enable the D outputs:</p>

        <p><center><img src="4_2.png" width="200" /></center></p>

        <p>As described in the datasheet, you can edit the "Contents"
          property to specify the contents of each memory location.  For
          example, to fill the first 4 locations of a 4-bit-wide ROM to
          the binary values 0000, 0101, 1010, and 1111, you could enter
          the following into the Contents property:</p>

        <pre>// comments are allowed, don't count as content lines
// 1 line per ROM location, starting at address 0
0b0000  // binary value
5       // decimal value
0xA     // hexadecimal value
0b1_111 // binary value, _ is ignored (useful for formatting)</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Use the Jade instance below to enter your design. To complete this
        design problem, select the /fsm/fsm module and click <i class="fa fa-check" style="color:green;"></i>
        in the Jade toolbar and the built-in tester
        will either report any discrepancies between the expected and actual
        outputs, or, if your design is correct, it will record the test passed.</p>

      <p>The tests verify that all the state transitions are correct
        by checking the values of <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> while the
        circuit is processing a sequence of <tt>IN</tt> values.  You can
        select the "Test" tab for the /fsm/fsm to see the input sequence
        and the expected values of <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> at each clock
        cycle.  The <tt>IN</tt> is changed before the rising edge of the
        clock and the values of <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> are checked just
        after the rising clock edge (i.e., after the most-recent value
        of <tt>IN</tt> has been processed).  There are comments on each
        test line indicating what the state of the FSM should be after
        processing the new <tt>IN</tt> value.</p>
