    <h3>Introduction to BSim</h3>

    <p>BSim is a simulator for the 6.004 Beta architecture.  BSim provides
      a simple editor for typing in your program and some tools for
      assembling the program into binary, loading the program into the
      simulated Beta's memory, executing the program and examining the
      results.
      
    <p>BSim incorporates CodeMirror for editing your .uasm files.
      CodeMirror supports many common edit operations &mdash; please
      see the table at the end of this document for the mapping from
      keystrokes to edit operations.  As you edit and whenever you
      click <button>Assemble</button> or run a simulation, the
      contents of your edit buffers will be saved on the server.  Use
      the tabs in the editor window to select a particular buffer to
      edit.  Tabs marked with <span class="fa fa-ban"></span> are
      read-only -- you can view their contents but not make any
      modifications.

    <p>To test your code, click on <button>Assemble</button> in the
      editor's toolbar.  This will assemble the current buffer, i.e.,
      convert it into binary and load it into the simulated Beta's
      memory.  Any errors detected will be flagged in the editor
      window and described in the message area at the bottom of the
      window.  If the assembly completes successfully, a pane showing
      the Beta datapath is displayed from which you can start
      execution of the program.

    <p>The Simulation pane has some additional toolbar buttons that are
      used to control the simulation.  The values shown in the window
      reflect the values on Beta signals after the current instruction has
      been fetched and executed but just before the register file and memory
      are updated at the end of the cycle.

      <table cellpadding=3 class="indent">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="tools_pause.png"</td>
                   <td>
                     Pause execution.
                   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="tools_reset.png"</td>
                   <td>
                     Reset the contents of the PC and registers to 0, and memory
                     locations to the values they had just after assembly was complete.
                   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="tools_start.png"</td>
                   <td>
                     Start simulation and run until a HALT() instruction is executed or
                     a breakpoint is reached.  You can stop a running simulation using
                     the pause control described above.  The display will be updated
                     every cycle.

                     The same as the play button described above, but only updates the
                     display once every 25,000 cycles for maximum simulation speed.

                     Execute the program for a single cycle and then update the
                     display.  Very useful for following your program's operation
                     instruction-by-instruction.

                     clicking the single cycle button more times than intended. This
                     button can only go back a limited number of steps.
                   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="tools_sview.png"</td>
                   <td>
                     Display the animated datapath in place of the programmer's panel
                   </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="tools_pview.png"</td>

                   </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    <p>To switch between the editor and simulation panes, use the "Editor"
      and "Simulation" buttons at the top left of the window. "Split" will
      divide the screen evenly between the two. It is also possible to drag
      the dividers between panes to resize them individually. When both the
      editor and simulation panes are visible, clicking "Assemble" will not
      alter the layout of the window.

    <p>If <tt>.options tty</tt> is specified by the program, the small
      typeout window at the bottom of the simulation pane may be
      accessed by the running program.  You can output characters to
      this window by executing a <tt>WRCHAR()</tt> instruction after
      placing the character value in <tt>R0</tt>.  The tty option also
      allows for type-in: any character typed by the user causes an
      interrupt to location 12; <tt>RDCHAR()</tt> can be used to fetch
      the character value into <tt>R0</tt>.  Clicking the mouse will
      cause an interrupts to location 16; <tt>CLICK()</tt> can be used
      to fetch the coordinates of the last click into R0.  The
      coordinates are encoded as (x&lt;&lt;16)+y, or &ndash;1 if there
      has been no mouse click since the last call to <tt>CLICK()</tt>.

    <p>If <tt>.options clock</tt> is specified by the program, an interrupt to
      location 8 is generated every 10,000 cycles.  (Remember though that
      interrupts are disabled until the program enters user mode &mdash; see
      section 6.3 of the Beta documentation.)

    <h3>BSim Cache Simulation</h3>

    <p/>Clicking on <button>Cache</button> in the BSim simulation pane shows
    the cache control panel:

    <p/><center><img border="0" width="100%" src="cache_ctl.png" /></center>

    <p/>The control panel is organized as three sections: left-to-right
    they are cache configuration, cache details, and cache statistics.

    <p/>There are six cache controls, all of which can be used while
    the simulator is running, so you can change the cache parameters
    on-the-fly.  Changes to the controls will reset the statistics.

    <ul>
      <li/><i>Cache</i>: turns the cache simulation on and off.
        
      <p/><li/><i>Total words</i>: The total number of 32-bit data words
      in the cache.  To test different cache architectures, typically this
      control remains fixed, while changing the other parameters to
      determine how these data words are organized into sets of cache lines.

      <p/><li/><i>Words/line</i>: The number of data words in each
      cache line, aka the block size of the cache.  The total number of
      cache lines in the cache is Total words divided by Words/line.

      <p/><li/><i>Associativity</i>: The number of "ways" in a set-associative
      cache.  "Direct mapped" refers to a 1-way cache.  The cache lines are
      apportioned equally between the ways.  In a fully-associative cache,
      the number of ways is chosen so that each way has exactly one cache
      line.

      <p/><li/><i>Replacement</i>: Determines the strategy used to
      choose which way is updated when a collision causes a cache miss.
      Not applicable for direct-mapped caches.  <i>LRU</i> = least-recently used,
      <i>FIFO</i> = first-in, first-out (sometimes referred to as
      least-recently replaced), <i>Random</i> = choice is made
      randomly, <i>Cycle</i> = choose the first way for first
      replacement, the second way for second replacement, and so on in a
      round-robin fashion.

      <p/><li/><i>Write strategy</i>: Determines how to compute the cycle cost
      of rewriting dirty cache lines to memory.  <i>Write-back</i> = cost is
      incurred once when the cache line is replaced.  <i>Write-through</i> =
      cost is incurred on each write to the cache line.

    </ul>

    <p/>The following cache details are provided:

    <ul>

      <p/><li/><i>Address bits</i>: shows how the 32 address bits from the
      Beta are used when accessing the cache.  The number of offset bits (minimum
      of two) is determined by the words/line.  The number of index bits is
      determined by the number of cache lines per way.  The remaining address
      bits become part of the tag to be compared with the tag field of the
      selected cache line.

      <p/><li/><i>Mem size</i>: <i>nways</i>*(<i>nlines</i>*<i>bits/line</i>).
      <i>nways</i> is determined by the associativity.  <i>nlines</i> is determined
      by the number of cache lines per way.  The <i>bits/line</i> includes the
      valid bit, dirty bit, tag field, and data bits (words/line * 32).

      <p/><li/><i>Comparator bits</i>: the number of bitwise comparisons needed
      to match the tag field, determined by the number of ways times the number
      of bits in the tag field.

      <p/><li/><i>2-to-1 MUX bits</i>: the number of 2-to-1 multiplexors needed
      to select the appropriate data word to return to the CPU if the number
      of words/line is greater than 1.  This requires a tree of 32-bit 2-to-1 muxes:
      the tree has depth 1 when words/line = 2, depth 2 when words/line = 4, and
      so on.  The total number of 2-to-1 muxes needed is 32*(words/line - 1).
      
      <p/><li/><i>Total cost</i>: an estimate (good for relative comparisons)
      of the total hardware cost including memory address logic, the memory data
      array, the memory sense amps, the tag comparators, and the MUX logic.
      All quantities are weighted by a rough estimate of their size in square
      microns.

    </ul>

    <p/>The following cache statistics are computed; the table is updated
    while the simulation is running.  <i>Ifetch</i> = instruction fetches,
    <i>Dread</i> = read data loads generated by LD/LDR instructions, <i>Dwrite</i> =
    write data stores generated by the ST instruction.

    <ul>

      <p/><li/><i>hits</i>: Count of memory accesses that resulted in a
      cache hit.

      <p/><li/><i>misses</i>: Count of memory accesses that result in a
      cache miss.

      <p/><li/><i>totals</i>: Count of all memory accesses = hits + misses.

      <p/><li/><i>hit ratio</i>: hits/totals.

      <p/><li/><i>cycles</i>: Total number of cycles needed to satisfy
      the memory requests to date.  Each access costs one cycle to access
      the cache.  Memory reads generated by cache line refills and memory
      writes generated by write-back or write-though of dirty cache
      lines cost 10 cycles for the first word and 1 additional cycle
      for each additional word on the cache line.
    </ul>



      <h3>Introduction to assembly language</h3>

    <p>BSim incorporates an assembler: a program that converts text files
      into binary memory data.  The simplest assembly language program is a
      sequence of numerical values which are converted to binary and placed
      in successive byte locations in memory:
      <pre>
        // Comments begin with a double slash and end at a newline
        /* Multi-line comments are also available, and continue until
        reaching the termination sequence, */
        
        37  3   255     // decimal (the default radix)
        0b100101        // binary (note the 0b prefix)
        0x25            // hexadecimal (note the 0x prefix)
        'a'             // character constants
      </pre>
    <p>Values can also be expressions; e.g., the source file
      <pre>
        37+0b10&ndash;0x10    24 &ndash; 0x1  4*0b110&ndash;1   0xF7 % 0x20
      </pre>
      generates 4 bytes of binary output, each with the value 23.  Note the
      operators have no precedence – you have to use parentheses to avoid
      simple left-to-right evaluation.  The available operators are

    <p><table border=1 cellpadding=3  class="indent">
        <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Operation</th></tr>
        <tr><td>&ndash;</td><td>unary minus</td></tr>
        <tr><td>~</td><td>bit-wise complement</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&</td><td>bit-wise AND</td></tr>
        <tr><td>|</td><td>bit-wise OR</td></tr>
        <tr><td>+</td><td>addition</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&ndash;</td><td>subtraction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>*</td><td>multiplication</td></tr>
        <tr><td>/</td><td>division</td></tr>
        <tr><td>%</td><td>modulo (result is always positive!)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&gt;&gt;</td><td>right shift</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&lt;&lt;</td><td>left shift</td></tr>
      </table>

    <p>We can also define symbols for use in expressions:
      <pre>
        x = 0x1000       // address in memory of variable X
        y = 0x10004      // another address

        // Symbolic names for registers
        R0 = 0
	R1 = 1
	&hellip;
	R31 = 31
      </pre>
    <p>Note that symbols are case-sensitive: <tt>Foo</tt> and <tt>foo</tt> are different
      symbols.  A special symbol named "." (period) means the address of the
      next byte to be filled by the assembler:
      <pre>
        . = 0x100        // assemble into location 0x100
        1  2  3  4
        five = .         // symbol five has the value 0x104
        5  6  7  8
        . = . + 16       // skip 16 bytes
        9 10 11 12
      </pre>
    <p>Labels are symbols that represent memory address.  They can be set
      with the following special syntax:
      <pre>
        X:               // this is an abbreviation for X = .
      </pre>
      For example the table on the left shows what main memory will contain
      after assembling the program on the right.
      <pre>
        ---- MAIN MEMORY ----         
        byte:  3  2  1  0
        . = 0x1000
        1000: 09 04 01 00            sqrs:  0 1 4 9
        1004: 31 24 19 10                   16 25 36 49
        1008: 79 64 51 40                   64 81 100 121
        100C: E1 C4 A9 90                   144 169 196 225
        1010: 00 00 00 10            slen:  LONG(. &ndash; sqrs)
      </pre>
    <p>Macros are parameterized abbreviations:
      <pre>
        // macro to generate 4 consecutive bytes
        .macro consec(n) n n+1 n+2 n+3

        // invocation of above macro
        consec(37)
      </pre>
      The macro invocation above has the same effect as
      <pre>
        37 38 39 40
      </pre>
      Note that macros evaluate their arguments and substitute the resulting
      value for occurrences of the corresponding formal parameter in the
      body of the macro.  Here are some macros for breaking multi-byte data
      into byte-size chunks
      <pre>
        // assemble into bytes, little-endian format
        .macro WORD(x) x%256 (x/256)%256
        .macro LONG(x) WORD(x) WORD(x>>16)
            LONG(0xdeadbeef)
</pre>
which has the same effect as
<pre>
  0xef 0xbe 0xad 0xde
</pre>
The body of the macro includes the remainder of the line on which the
.macro directive appears.  Multi-line macros can be defined by
enclosing the body in "{" and "}".

<p>beta.uasm contains symbol definitions for all the registers (R0, &hellip;,
  R31, BP, LP, SP, XP, r0, &hellip;, r31, bp, lp, sp, xp) and macro definitions
  for all the Beta instructions:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=3 class="indent">
    <tr>
      <td>OP(Ra,Rb,Rc)<br>Opcodes:</td>
      <td>Reg[Rc] &larr; Reg[Ra] op Reg[Rb]<br>
        ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR, XOR<br>
        CMPEQ, CMPLT, CMPLE, SHL, SHR, SRA<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>OPC(Ra,literal,Rc)<br>Opcodes:</td>
      <td>Reg[Rc] &larr; Reg[Ra] op SEXT(literal15:0)<br>
        ADDC, SUBC, MULC, DIVC, ANDC, ORC, XORC<br>
        CMPEQC, CMPLTC, CMPLEC, SHLC, SHRC, SRAC
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>LD(Ra,literal,Rc)</td><td>Reg[Rc] &larr; Mem[Reg[Ra] + SEXT(literal)]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ST(Rc,literal,Ra)</td><td>Mem[Reg[Ra] + SEXT(literal)] &larr; Reg[Rc]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>JMP(Ra,Rc)</td><td>Reg[Rc] &larr; PC + 4; PC &larr; Reg[Ra]</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BEQ/BF(Ra,label,Rc)</td><td>Reg[Rc] &larr; PC + 4;<br>if Reg[Ra] == 0 then PC &larr; PC + 4 + 4*SEXT(literal)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BNE/BT(Ra,label,Rc)</td><td>Reg[Rc] &larr; PC + 4;<br>if Reg[Ra] != 0 then PC &larr; PC + 4 + 4*SEXT(literal)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LDR(Ra,label,Rc)</td><td>Reg[Rc] &larr; Mem[PC + 4 + 4*SEXT(literal)]</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>Also included are some convenience macros:
  <pre>
    LD(label,Rc) expands to LD(R31,label,Rc)
    ST(Ra,label) expands to ST(Ra,label,R31)
    BR(label) expands to BEQ(R31,label,R31)
    CALL(label) expands to BEQ(R31,label,LP)
    RTN() expands to JMP(LP)
    DEALLOCATE(n) expands to SUBC(SP,n*4,SP)
    MOVE(Ra,Rc) expands to ADD(Ra,R31,Rc)
    CMOVE(literal,Rc) expands to ADDC(R31,literal,Rc)
    PUSH(Ra) expands to ADDC(SP,4,SP) ST(Ra,-4,SP)
    POP(Rc) expands to LD(SP,-4,Rc)  ADDC(SP,-4,SP)

    HALT() cause the simulator to stop execution
  </pre>
  
<p>The following is a complete example assembly language program:
  <pre>
    .include "/shared/bsim/beta.uasm"

    . = 0         // start assembling at location 0
    LD(input,r0)  // put argument in r0
    CALL(bitrev)  // call the procedure (= BR(bitrev,r28))
    HALT()

    // reverse the bits in r0, leave result in r1
    bitrev:
    CMOVE(32,r2)  // loop counter
    CMOVE(0,r1)   // clear output register
    loop:
    ANDC(r0,1,r3) // get low-order bit
    SHLC(r1,1,r1) // shift output word by 1
    OR(r3,r1,r1)  // OR in new low-order bit
    SHRC(r0,1,r0) // done with this input bit
    SUBC(r2,1,r2) // decrement loop counter
    BNE(r2,loop)  // repeat until done
    RTN()         // return to caller  (= JMP(r28))

    input:
    LONG(0x12345) // 32-bit input (in HEX)
  </pre>

<p>The BSim assembly language processor includes a few helpful directives:

<p><tt>.include "buffer_name"</tt>
  <ul>
    Process the text found in the specified buffer at this point in the
    assembly. The buffer name must be given as a string.
  </ul>

<p><tt>.align<br>.align expression</tt>
  <ul>
    Increment the value of "." until it is 0 modulo the specified value,
    e.g., <tt>.align 4</tt> moves to the next word boundary in memory.  A value
    of 4 is used if no expression is given.
  </ul>

<p><tt>.ascii "chars&hellip;"</tt>
  <ul>
    Assemble the characters enclosed in quotes into successive bytes of
    memory.  C-like escapes can be used for non-printing characters.
  </ul>

<p><tt>.text "chars&hellip;"</tt>
  <ul>
    Like <tt>.ascii</tt> except an additional 0 byte is added to the end of the
    string in memory and the next byte assembled will be word-aligned.
  </ul

     <p><tt>.breakpoint</tt>
       <ul>
         Stop the Beta simulator if it fetches an instruction from the current
         location (i.e., the value of "." at the point the <tt>.breakpoint</tt>
         directive occurred).  You can define as many breakpoints as you want.
       </ul>

     <p><tt>.protect</tt>
       <ul>
         This directive indicates that subsequent bytes output by the assembler
         are protected, causing the simulator to halt if a ST instruction
         tries to overwrite their value.  This directive is useful for
         protecting code (e.g., the checkoff program) from being overwritten by
