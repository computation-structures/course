      <h3>Problem 1.  Design Problem: Tiny OS</h3>

      <p>See below for instructions.</p>

      <p>Use the Bsim instance below to enter your code.  Your buffer is
        autosaved to the server every few characters, when you click
        <button>Assemble</button>, or when a running simulation halts.
        If you received a message about unsaved changes when attempting
        to close the BSim window, just click <button>Assemble</button>
        and your changes will be saved.</p>

      <p>To complete this design problem, please follow the instructions
        below, which will ask you to modify the TinyOS code to add some
        new functionality.  There is no automated test for the lab, so
        you&#700;ll need to run the tests described in the instructions to see
        if you&#700;ve meet the design criteria.</p>

      <answer id="bsim" type="window" tool_name="BSim" width="900" height="600" src="../tools/bsim_workbook.html">{
        "required_tests": ["36036"],
        "initial_state" : {
        "beta.uasm": "url:../beta.json",
        "TinyOS.uasm": "url:../lab10_tinyos/tinyos.json"
        },
        "state":{"Tiny OS":"url:../lab10_tinyos/tinyos.json"}
        }</answer>

      <p><b>Instructions</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Copy the code from TinyOS.uasm into the Tiny OS in the BSim window</li>

        <li>Look through the code to figure out how it works.</li>

        <li>Modify your copy of the code as described below and test your changes</li>

        <li>There is no automated check-in for the lab.  When you are ready
          for checkoff, complete a check-off meeting during staffed lab
          hours (preferably during the less hectic times early in the week).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>TinyOS.uasm implements a simple timesharing system (or will after you
        complete Problem 1!).  There is kernel code to deal with supervisor calls,
        illops, and keyboard interrupts, along utility functions for printing out
        console messages, etc.  And initially there are two user-mode processes:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><i>Process 0</i>: reads characters from the keyboard,
          echoing them to the console.  When the return key is entered,
          the sentence is translated into pig latin and the result also
          printed to the console.  Then the process repeats.</li>

        <li><i>Process 1</i>: Each time this process runs, it
          increments a counter and then uses the <tt>Yield()</tt> supervisor call
          to give up the rest of its timesharing slot.  Every 4096
          iterations, the process prints the count to the console.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>There are three design problems that ask you to modify TinyOS.
        You must complete the first problem, but the last two are
        optional, providing additional points should they be completed
        successfully.</p>

      <p><b>Memory Management Unit</b></p>

      <p>BSim implements a very simple memory-management mechanism
        called <i>base and bounds</i> when "<tt>.options
          segmentation</tt>" is included in the program.  The MMU contains
        two control registers, SEG_BASE and SEG_BOUNDS, which the Beta can
        access using LD and ST instructions. Here&#700;s how it works:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> When running in kernel mode (PC[31]=1), there is no
          address translation, i.e., the kernel virtual address is used
          directly the physical address for main memory.  On startup, the
          Beta is running in kernel mode.</li>

        <li> When running in user mode (PC[31]=0), address
          translation is enabled, which allows each user-mode process to
          run in its own virtual address space.  Each user-mode address is
          translated to a physical address as follows:</li>

        <ul>

          <li> the user-mode address is compared against the value
            in the MMU SEG_BOUNDS control register.  If the address is greater
            than or equal to the SEG_BOUNDS value, a segmentation fault
            occurs: PC+4 is saved in the XP register and the PC is set to
            0x80000008.  Note that the value saved in XP is a user-mode
            virtual address.  If the bounds check succeeds, proceed to the next step.</li>

          <li> the user-mode address is added to the value in the
            built-in MMU SEG_BASE control register to form the physical
            address used to access main memory.</li>

        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>The net effect is that the user-mode virtual address space
        is mapped to a contiguous region of physical memory that starts
        at the location specified by the SEG_BASE control register.  The size of the
        region (and hence the size of the virtual address space) is
        determined by the SEG_BOUNDS control register.</p>

      <p> The appropriate base and bounds values for each process are
        kept in the process table, along with the saved register values.
        When getting ready to run a user-mode process, the kernel
        initializes the MMU SEG_BASE and SEG_BOUNDS control registers
        using ST instructions to two reserved memory addresses, which the
        Beta interprets as accesses to the MMU control registers.</p>

      <pre class="jsim">LD(CurProc, r0)     // pointer to current process table entry
LD(r0, 31*4, r2)    // load base value from proc table
ST(r2, SEG_BASE)    // store into MMU SEG_BASE control register
LD(r0, 32*4, r2)    // load bounds value from proc table
ST(r2, SEG_BOUNDS)  // store into MMU SEG_BOUNDS control register</pre>

      <p>Where do the appropriate base and bound values come from?  They are
        determined at assembly time.  To enter code and data for a user-mode process, use
        the <tt>.segment XXX</tt> directive to tell the assembler to start
        a new user-mode segment called <tt>XXX</tt>.  Each user-mode segment has
        its own symbol table and is assumed to start at virtual address 0.  Here&#700;s
        a very simple user-mode process that initializes a stack, then enters
        an infinite loop incrementing a counter in main memory:</p>

      <pre class="jsim">        .segment Example
        . = 0                // just a reminder that we start at 0
        CMOVE(stack, SP)     // initialize the stack pointer
loop:   LD(counter, r0)      // load counter value
        ADDC(r0, 1, r0)      // increment...
        ST(r0, counter)      // store back into main memory
        BR(loop)             // repeat

counter:
        LONG(0)              // storage for counter, initialized to 0
        
stack:
        STORAGE(100)         // reserve 100 words for the stack</pre>

      <p>When assembled, two new symbols are defined the kernel&#700;s symbol table:
        <tt>Example_base</tt> with the address of the physical memory
        location occupied by the first word of the segment (in this case
        the physical address of the <tt>CMOVE</tt> instruction),
        and <tt>Example_bounds</tt> with a value equal to the size of the
        segment in bytes, including both instructions and data.</p>

      <p>Note that since execution of this user-mode process will begin at location
        0, that location should contain an instruction!</p>

      <p>The initial process table entry for this user-mode process would
        look like</p>

      <pre class="jsim">STORAGE(30)          // storage for registers 0-29
LONG(0)              // storage for XP (initial PC is 0)
LONG(Example_base)   // process table copy of SEG_BASE
LONG(Example_bounds) // process table copy of SEG_BOUNDS</pre>

      <h3>Design Problem 1: MapUserAddress</h3>

      <p>There are times when given a user-mode address, the kernel needs to
        read the contents of that location.  For example, when processing an ILLOP
        exception, the kernel reads the offending instruction from memory and checks
        the opcode field to see if it&#700;s a SVC.  The kernel code to do this looks like</p>

      <pre class="jsim">SUBC(XP, 4, r0)         // u-mode address of illegal instruction
CALL(MapUserAddress)    // convert to k-mode address
LD(r0, 0, r0)           // Fetch the illegal instruction
SHRC(r0, 26, r0)        // Extract the 6-bit OPCODE</pre>

      <p>Your task is to write the code for the <tt>MapUserAddress</tt> procedure
        (search for "[Design Problem 1]" in the TinyOS code.  This procedure emulates
        in software what the MMU does in hardware: converting a user-mode virtual
        address to the corresponding physical address.</p>

      <p>Once <tt>MapUserAddress</tt> is functioning correctly, the pre-defined
        process 0 and process 1 code should run correctly.  So if you
        start the simulation of the assembled code, select the console at
        the bottom of the simulation pane with a <i>single</i> click, then
        type "hello there" followed by RETURN, process 0 should type
        "ELLOHAY ERETHAY".  Meanwhile Process 1 will print out the value
        of its counter every now and then.</p>
      
      <h3>Design Problem 2: Add support for Mouse clicks</h3>

      <p><b>Step 1: Add mouse interrupt handler</b></p>

      <p>When you click the mouse over the console pane, BSim generates an
        interrupt, forcing the PC to <tt>0x80000014</tt> and saving PC+4 of the
        interrupted instruction in the XP register.  Note that BSim implements
        a "vectored interrupt" scheme where different types of interrupts
        force the PC to different addresses (rather than having all interrupts
        for the PC to one location).  The following table shows how different
        exceptions are mapped to PC values:</p>
      <ul>
        <tt>0x80000000</tt> reset<br/>
        <tt>0x80000004</tt> illegal opcode<br/>
        <tt>0x80000008</tt> segmentation fault<br/>
        <tt>0x8000000C</tt> clock interrupt*<br/>
        <tt>0x80000010</tt> keyboard interrupt**<br/>
        <tt>0x80000014</tt> mouse interrupt**<br/>
        <br/>
        * must specify <tt>.options clk</tt> to enable<br/>
        ** must specify <tt>.options tty</tt> to enable<br/>
      </ul>

      <p>Recall that only user-mode programs can be interrupted.
        Interrupts signaled while in the Beta is running in kernel-mode (<i>e.g.</i>,
        handling another interrupt or servicing a supervisor call) have no
        effect until the processor returns to user-mode.</p>

      <p>The original TinyOS code prints out "Unexpected interrupt..." and then
        halts if a mouse interrupt is received.  Change this behavior in your
        copy of the code by adding an interrupt handler that stores the click
        information in a new kernel memory location and then returns to the
        interrupted process.  You might find the keyboard interrupt handler a
        good model to follow.</p>

      <p>We&#700;ve added a new Beta instruction your interrupt handler can use
        to retrieve information about the last mouse click:</p>
      <pre>     CLICK()</pre>

      <p>This instruction can only be executed when in kernel mode (<i>e.g.</i>,
        from inside an interrupt handler).  It returns a value in <tt>R0</tt>: -1 if
        there hasn&#700;t been a mouse click since the last time <tt>CLICK()</tt> was
        executed, or a 32-bit integer with the X coordinate of the click in
        the high-order 16 bits of the word, and the Y coordinate of the click
        in the low-order 16 bits.  The coordinates are non-negative and
        relative to the upper left hand corner of the console pane.  In our
        scenario, <tt>CLICK()</tt> is only called after a mouse click, so we should
        never see -1 as a return value.</p>

      <p>Testing your implementation: insert a <tt>.breakpoint</tt> before the
        <tt>JMP(XP)</tt> at the end of your interrupt handler, run the program and
        click the mouse over the console pane.  If things are working
        correctly the simulation should stop at the breakpoint and you can
        examine the kernel memory location where the mouse info was stored to
        verify that it&#700;s correct.  Continuing execution (click the "Run"
        button in the toolbar at the top of the window) should return to the
        interrupted program.  When you&#700;re done remember to remove the
        breakpoint.</p>

      <p><b>Step 2: Add Mouse() supervisor call</b></p>

      <p>Implement a <tt>Mouse()</tt> supervisor call that returns the coordinate
        information from the most recent mouse click (i.e., the information
        stored by the mouse interrupt handler).  Like the <tt>GetKey()</tt> supervisor
        call, a user-mode call to <tt>Mouse()</tt> should consume the available click
        information.  If no mouse click has occurred since the previous call
        to <tt>Mouse()</tt>, the supervisor call should "hang" until new click
        information is available.  "Hang" means that the supervisor call
        should back up the saved PC so that the next user-mode instruction to
        be executed is the <tt>Mouse()</tt> call and then branch to the scheduler to
        run some other user-mode program.  Thus when the calling program is
        rescheduled for execution at some later point, the <tt>Mouse()</tt> call is
        re-executed and the whole process repeated.  From the user&#700;s point of
        view, the <tt>Mouse()</tt> call completes execution only when there is new
        click information to be returned.  The <tt>GetKey()</tt> supervisor call is a
        good model to follow.</p>

      <p>Notes: Supervisor calls are actually unimplemented instructions
        that cause the expected trap when executed.  The illegal instruction
        trap handler looks for illegal instructions it knows to be supervisor
        calls and calls the appropriate handler -- look at <tt>SVC_UUO</tt> for details.
        To define a new supervisor call, add the following definition just
        after the definition for <tt>Yield()</tt>:</p>
      <pre>     .macro Mouse()   SVC(8)</pre>

      <p>This is the ninth supervisor call and the current code at <tt>SVC_UUO</tt>
        was tailored for processing exactly eight supervisor calls, so <b>you&#700;ll
          need to make the appropriate modifications</b>.</p>

      <p><b>Step 3: Add third user-mode process that reports mouse clicks</b></p>

      <p>Modify the process table in the kernel to add the appropriate entry
        for a third user-mode process P2.</p>

      <p>You should then define a new segment called P2 and add user-mode code for the
        new process that calls <tt>Mouse()</tt> and then prints out a
        message of the form:</p>

      <pre>     Click at x=000000EE, y=00000041</pre>

      <p>Each click message should appear on its own line (<i>i.e.</i>, it should
        be preceded and followed by a newline character).  You can use <tt>WrMsg()</tt>
        and <tt>HexPrt()</tt> to send the message; see the code for Process 0 for an
        example of how this is done.</p>

      <p><i>Testing your implementation:</i> If all three steps are working
        correctly the appropriate message should be printed out whenever you
        click the mouse over the console pane.  You may find it necessary to
        use <tt>.breakpoint</tt> commands to debug your user-mode code.</p>

      <h3>Design Problem 3: Add Signal() and Wait() SVCs</h3>

      <p>After Problem 2, there are now three user-mode processes that want to
        print messages to the console.  Depending on timing of user input and the
        scheduling of processes, the printouts may interleave in a way that&#700;s very
        hard to read.</p>

      <p>We&#700;ll use a semaphore to ensure that each process&#700; printout is completed
        without interference from the other processes.  In other words, think of the
        console as a shared resource, which should only be accessed by one process
        at a time.</p>

      <p>Your first task is to implement the handlers for the <tt>Signal()</tt> and
        <tt>Wait()</tt> SVCs.  TinyOS supports a fixed number N of integer semaphores numbered 0
        through N-1 (N = 4 in the current code).  The semaphore number for the SVCs
        is passed in the user&#700;s R0.  If the value in the user&#700;s R0 is not between
        0 and N-1 inclusive, the SVCs should simply resume user-mode execution after
        the SVC.</p>

      <p>The <tt>Signal()</tt> SVC increments the value of the specified semaphore,
        then resumes user-mode execution after the SVC.  For example,</p>

      <pre class="jsim">CMOVE(1, r0)     // signal semaphore #1
Signal()</pre>

      <p>The <tt>Wait()</tt> SVC tests the value of the specified
        semaphore.  If the value is greater than 0, it&#700;s decremented, then
        user-mode execution resumes after the SVC.  If the value equals 0,
        the WAIT operation cannot be completed as this time, so the kernel
        handler should arrange to re-execute the SVC when execution resumes,
        then run the next process.  The next time the WAITing process runs,
        it will once again test the value of the specified semaphore.  For
        example,</p>

      <pre class="jsim">CMOVE(1, r0)     // wait on semaphore #1
Wait()
// execution resumes here only after the WAIT succeeds</pre>

      <p>Add the appropriate <tt>Signal()</tt> and <tt>Wait()</tt> SVC
        calls to processes 0, 1, and 2 so that once a process starts to
        print on the console, all the other processes must wait until the
        printout is complete.</p>
