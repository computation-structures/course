<b>Lab 4.2 Design Problem: Quicksort</b>

<p/>Suppose you have an array of N integers, and wish to sort them
into ascending order.  There are a variety of approaches you might
use, ranging from the
<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8">maligned</a>
<em>bubble sort</em> which takes O(N<sup>2</sup>) time, to faster approaches
such as <em>quicksort</em> that averages O(N log N) time.  Quicksort
uses an elegantly simple <em>divide and conquer</em>
approach to sorting an array:
<ol>
  <li>Pick a <em>pivot</em> value from among the array elements,
  and remove that element from the array.</li>
  <li>Partition the array into two smaller arrays, containing
  elements whose values are smaller or larger than the pivot value,
  respectively.</li>
  <li>Call quicksort recursively to sort each of the two smaller
  arrays.</li>
  <li>Finally, combine the sorted smaller-value array, the pivot
  element, and the sorted larger-value array into a single sorted
  result.</li>
</ol>
This description glosses over several details which may vary by
implementation; for example, which of the two smaller arrays should
contain elements that are <em>equal</em> to the pivot value.

<p/>
A high-level Python approach to quicksort of a list is:
<pre class="jsim">def qsort1(list):
  if list == []: return []
  else:
      pivot = list[0]       # arbitrarily choose first element
      lesser = qsort1([x for x in list[1:] if x &lt; pivot])
      greater = qsort1([x for x in list[1:] if x &gt;= pivot])
      return lesser + [pivot] + greater
</pre>

<p/>
Often it is preferable to sort an array <em>in place</em>, rather
than allocating space for the resulting new array.  A version of
quicksort for in-place sorting is given in
<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#In-place_version">
Wikipedia</a> as

<pre class="jsim"># in-place partition of subarray
#   left is the index of the leftmost element of the subarray
#   right is the index of the rightmost element of the
#     subarray (inclusive)
def partition(array,left,right):
    # choose middle element of array as pivot
    pivotIndex = (left+right) >> 1
    pivotValue = array[pivotIndex]

    # swap array[right] and array[pivotIndex]
    # note that we already store array[pivotIndex] in pivotValue
    array[pivotIndex] = array[right]

    # elements &lt;= the pivot are moved to the left (smaller indices)
    storeIndex = left
    for i in xrange(left,right):  # don't include array[right]
        temp = array[i]
        if temp &lt;= pivotValue:
            array[i] = array[storeIndex]
            array[storeIndex] = temp
            storeIndex += 1

    # move pivot to its final place
    array[right] = array[storeIndex]
    array[storeIndex] = pivotValue
    return storeIndex

def quicksort(array, left, right):
    if left &lt; right:
        pivotIndex = partition(array,left,right)
        quicksort(array,left,pivotIndex-1)
        quicksort(array,pivotIndex+1,right)
</pre>
Although this code is nominally in Python, it is substantially
identical to C code.
<p/>
Note that the code for both <code>quicksort</code> and <code>partition</code>
identifies a range of consecutive elements in the <code>array</code> by
two integers, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, that identify the
array indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements within the range
respectively.  In contrast to usual C and Python practice, the indicated
range includes both the left and right elements: thus, the only way
to designate an empty (zero-length) subrange is by having
<code>right</code>&lt;<code>left</code>.

<p/>
Your job is to translate this in-place version of quicksort to
Beta assembly language.  You can begin by copying the file
<code>/shared/bsim/lab4-template.uasm</code>, which contains the
appropriate checkoff setup and dummy (empty) definitions for the
procedures <code>quicksort</code> and <code>partition</code>.  It also
includes the above Python/C versions of the code as comments.

<p/>Arrays are stored in consecutive locations of memory.  In this
lab, we're dealing with arrays of integers, so each array element
occupies a 32-bit word.  Since the memory is byte addressed,
consecutive elements of an integer array have addresses that differ by 4.
Integer arrays are always <i>word aligned</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the byte
addresses of array elements have <tt>00</tt> as the low-order two address
bits.  When a program refers to an entire array, the value that gets
passed around is the address of the first array element, <i>i.e.</i>,
the address of <tt>array[0]</tt>.  For example,
here's a simple procedure that adds two consecutive array elements:
<pre class="jsim">
def add_pair(array,i): return array[i] + array[i+1]
</pre>
The corresponding assembly language code would be
<pre class="jsim">
add_pair:
     PUSH(LP)       // standard entry sequence
     PUSH(BP)
     MOVE(SP,BP)
     PUSH(R1)       // save registers we use below

     LD(BP,-12,R1)  // R1 = address of array[0]
     LD(BP,-16,R0)  // R0 = i

     // now we have to convert index i into the appropriate
     // address offset from the start of the array.  Since
     // each array element occupies 4 bytes, we multiply the
     // index by 4 to convert it to a byte offset.
     SHLC(R0,2,R0)  // shift left by 2 = multiply by 4
     ADD(R0,R1,R1)  // R1 = address of array[i]

     LD(R1,0,R0)    // R0 = array[i]
     LD(R1,4,R1)    // R1 = array[i+1]
     ADD(R1,R0,R0)  // R0 = array[i] + array[i+1]

     POP(R1)        // restore saved registers
     MOVE(BP,SP)    // standard exit sequence
     POP(BP)
     POP(LP)
     JMP(LP)
</pre>

<p/>
    <b><em>Setup:</em></b>
    The <code>Lab 4</code> tab in the BSim window has been initialized with the code from
    the <code>template.uasm</code> tab.  Look it over briefly;
    notice that the dummy procedures included are valid (<em>e.g.</em>, they
    obey stack discipline and our linkage conventions) but devoid of any
    function.
    <p/>
    Select the <code>Lab 4</code> tab in the BSim window, click <em>Assemble</em>
    to translate it to binary.  If successful, you'll now see a
    window onto an operating (simulated) Beta running the binary
    translation of your program.  The upper-left displays the contents
    of the Beta's registers, the lower-left a region of memory containing
    the translated code, and to the right two regions of memory (one
    near the top of the stack.  Explore this view a bit: scroll the
    lower-left region and observe labels, hex values, and (where
    sensible) values decoded as Beta instructions.
    Most of these are from the checkoff program and associated infrastructure;
    but at the end of the non-zero contents, you'll see your empty
    partition and quicksort procedures.
    <p/>
    Run the code, by hitting the <em>play</em> button; you'll see the
    Beta stepping through instructions, updating the display.

    <div class="hint">
    <b>Hint:</b> You can click on the "Split" button to configure the BSim window to show
    both your editor windows and the Beta simulation display.  The simulator
    will highlight the line in your source code that generated the current
    Beta instruction, assuming that source line came from the currently
    selected editor window.  You can watch the Beta scroll through your
    program making it easy to watch your code being executed.
    </div>

    When you get tired of watching this show, hit <em>pause</em> and
    then <em>fast forward</em> to execute without the tedious display
    updates.  You should see some output from the checkoff program in
    the <em>console</em> window at the bottom of your screen.
    <p/>
    <em>Good news</em> - you've passed the first two test cases!  Looking
    at the console output, notice that Test 1 involves a sequence of 1
    element, and Test 2 involves a sequence of length 2 thats already in
    order.  These trivial test cases are already sorted, so your do-nothing
    quicksort (which, in its defense, at least does no damage) passes these
    tests.  The third test, which actually needs some sorting, should fail.

<p/>
    <b><em>TestCase:</em></b>
    Lets focus on the failed test: change the <code>LONG(0)</code> in the location
    labeled <em>TestCase</em> near the beginning of your <em>lab4.uasm</em> file
    to read <code>LONG(3)</code>.  This tells the checkoff program to run only the
    third test, making debugging that test a bit less tedious.
    <p/>
    Our principal debugging tool is the <em>breakpoint</em>, a marker that
    can be inserted into our program at interesting points to cause it to pause and let us poke
    around.
    <p/>
    Insert the line
    <pre>     .breakpoint</pre>
    in your empty <code>quicksort</code> procedure, immediately following the line
    reading
    <pre>     // Fill in your code here...</pre>
    and run it again.  The simulation should stop when you hit the inserted
    breakpoint, allowing you to examine the state of the Beta and its memory
    at that point.

<p class="question">Question (A). Looking at the state of the Beta, determine the value in <code>R20</code>
and enter your answer in the appropriate answer box in the Lab 4 write-up.</p>

<p/>    In fact, you'll notice systematic values in registers; these are used by
    the checkoff program to check that you're properly saving/restoring registers.

<p/>
    Your next project, and the main task of this lab, is to fill in the code for
    the two procedures and get them working correctly.  Although you may code these
    procedures however you like, we recommend paying careful attention to details
    in the Python/C versions supplied; seemingly minor variations (&lt; rather
    than &lt;=, including/excluding the rightmost element in a loop) can cause
    errors taking hours to debug.
    <p/>
    While you may vary the order in which you approach the coding of these
    procedures, we suggest the following sequence of steps:

<p/>
    <b><em>quicksort stub:</em></b>
    Implement the first part of <code>quicksort</code>: the call to <code>partition</code>.
    Using a breakpoint in <code>partition</code>, ensure that its called with the proper
    arguments (identical to those of <code>quicksort</code>).  Try it on the first few
    test cases by varying the value in <code>TestCase</code>.
  </subquestion>

<p/>
    <b><em>partition:</em></b>
    Implement the code in <code>partition</code>, and debug it (again, using various
    test cases).  Although this code is more complex than <code>quicksort</code>, it
    avoids the complication of recursive calls, making debugging easier.
    Once you're convinced <code>partition</code> works properly, move on to the next step.
  </subquestion>

<div class="hint">
<b>Hint:</b> The <code>partition</code> code involves a number of local variables.
Although you can allocate these variables in the stack frame (as we have
done in examples given in lecture), your code may be both smaller and
more readable if you allocate registers to hold local variables.  One
convenient way to do this is to define symbolic names, <i>e.g.</i>,
<pre class="jsim">
  p_array=R2          // base address of array (arg 0)
  p_left=R3
  p_right=R4
  p_pivotIndex=R5     // Corresponds to PivotIndex in C program
  p_pivotValue=R6
  p_storeIndex=R7
  ...
</pre>
Note that the <code>p_</code> prefixes are prepended to avoid name conflicts
with other such assignments.  Of course, you must remember to save and
restore the values of any register you use in this (or any other) fashion!
<p/>
Even if you choose to store these variables in the local stack frame,
you will likely find symbolic names (defined as the variable offsets)
easier to use than generic <code>Rx</code> register names.
<p/>
<b>Remember:</b> A procedure can use <tt>R0</tt> with impunity, since the caller is expecting
that to change to contain the return value.  But if you use any other register
(<tt>R1</tt>, <tt>R2</tt>, ...) it must have the same value after the procedure as it did when the
procedure is called.  For each register <tt>Rx</tt> that the procedure uses, there should be
a <tt>PUSH(Rx)</tt> in the entry sequence and a <tt>POP(Rx)</tt> at the corresponding
part of the exit sequence.
</div>

<p/>
    <b><em>quicksort:</em></b>
    Complete the <code>quicksort</code> procedure, and get it to run correctly
    on all the test cases by setting the value in <code>TestCase</code> to zero.
    Once all tests have passed, you can validate your solution by clicking
    the <button>Check &amp; Save</button> button.

<p/>
    <b><em>Stack crawling:</em></b>
    The <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> values passed to <code>quicksort</code>
    are described as indices of <code>array</code> elements, implying that they
    range from zero through one less than the length of <code>array</code>.
    This constraint turns out to be not strictly true in all cases in our implementation.
    As our last exercise, we'll explore an exception that arises during
    execution of our <code>quicksort</code> implementation.
    <p/>
    Insert a breakpoint in your <code>quicksort</code> procedure, after the stack
    frame has been set up and interesting values (<em>e.g.</em>, arguments)
    have been loaded into registers.  Set <code>TestCase</code> to contain 13 (running
    only the last test case), and run your code.
    <p/>
    When it stops at your breakpoint, check the value that was passed as the
    <code>right</code> argument.  If its non-negative, click <em>fast forward</em> to continue
    until you hit the breakpoint again; click again, and keep clicking until you get
    to the breakpoint with a
    <b><em>negative</em></b>
    value for <code>right</code>.
    <p/>
    At this point, you are several calls deep in the recursion of quicksort.  By
    inspecting values in registers and on the stack, you can determine both the
    current state of the computation and the call history that led us here.

    <p class="question">
    Question (B): Find the tow arguments to the current call and enter the values in the appropriate
    answer boxes in the Lab 4 write-up.</p>

    <p class="question">
    Question (C): What's the current value in element zero of the array?</p>

    <p/>
    Note the relation between the element zero value and the other
    values in the array.  If you look a bit at the code and
    think about the behavior of
    your two procedures, you can see how the negative value arises
    and convince yourself that it does no harm to the computation.
    It is, however, a bit sloppy for the author of this code not to
    have documented this anomaly in an explanatory comment!

<p/>
    <b><em>BP Chain:</em></b>
    Observe where BP points into your stack frame, and the location
    of the saved LP value relative to this point.  Scroll the disassembly
    window of BSim and find the two recursive calls within <code>quicksort</code>;
    note the hex locations of the instructions <em>following</em> each call.
    Write down these values;
    they will be saved LP values in stack frames associated with
    recursive calls, and can be used to distinguish recursive calls from
    the original call by the checkoff code.


<p class="question">
      Question (D): 
      By inspecting the saved LP value, determine whether the current
      recursive call to <code>quicksort</code> is from the first recursive
      call (sorting the array of smaller elements) or the second within
      <code>quicksort</code>.</p>

    <p class="question">
    Question (E): Find the saved BP, which points to the stack frame for
    the prior call to <code>quicksort</code>; find the arguments to that call.</p>

    <p class="question">
    Question (F): Follow the BP chain back to the original call, and report
    the recursion depth (number of active calls) when the
    negative argument is encountered.  Note that a couple of
    frames at the bottom of the stack belong to procedures
    in the testing code -- we only want you to count frames
    belonging to quicksort.  Think about how you can distinguish
    quicksort frames from test code frames.</p>

<p/>You're done!
