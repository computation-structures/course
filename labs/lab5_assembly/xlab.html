      <p><b>Instructions</b></p>

      <p>Suppose you have an array of integers and wish to sort them into
      ascending order.  There are a variety of approaches you might use --
      one of the simplest (but slowest) is the bubble sort algorithm.
      Bubble sort makes multiple passes through the array swapping the
      previous element with the current element is if the previous element
      is larger.  If no swaps occur on a pass, then bubble sort terminates
      and the array is sorted in ascending order.  If a swap does
      occur, another pass is made.</p>

      <p>Here are the steps in the bubble sort algorithm.  <tt>A</tt> is
      the array to be sorted; actually the value of the symbol <tt>A</tt> is the
      address of the first element of the array, <tt>A[0]</tt>.
      The value of the symbol <tt>ALEN</tt> is the number of elements
      in <tt>A</tt>, called the length of the array.  The elements
      of <tt>A</tt> are <tt>A[0]</tt>,  <tt>A[1]</tt>, ..., and <tt>A[ALEN-1]</tt>.
      The algorithm makes use of several variables: <tt>i</tt>
      and <tt>swapped</tt>.</p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li> Set <tt>swapped</tt> to 0.</li>

        <li> Set <tt>i</tt> to 0.</li>

        <li> Increment <tt>i</tt>.  If <tt>i</tt> is now greater than
        or equal to <tt>ALEN</tt>, this pass through the array is complete
        so go to step 5.  Otherwise continue with the next step.</li>

        <li> If <tt>A[i-1]</tt> is less than or equal to <tt>A[i]</tt>,
        go to step 3.  Otherwise swap <tt>A[i-1]</tt> and <tt>A[i]</tt>,
        set <tt>swapped</tt> to 1, then go to step 3.</li>

        <li> if <tt>swapped</tt> is 1, go to step 1 and start another
        pass.  Otherwise a pass was completed with no swaps, so the bubble
        sort is complete.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>There are a number of simple optimizations that can be made to this algorithm
      in order to reduce the total number of steps needed to complete the bubble sort.
      See the Implementation section of the <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Wikipedia article</A>
      on bubble sort for more details.</p>

      <p>Your task is to write an implementation of bubble sort in Beta assembly
      language.  You'll enter your code in the BSim window on the lab page.  See
      the BSim documentation on how to assemble and run your code for testing.</p>

      <p>Here's the template you'll see in the "Bubble_sort" tab of the BSim window.
      It includes <tt>beta.uasm</tt>, which describes the Beta instructions to the
      built-in assembler.  The initial <tt>BR(STEP1)</tt> causes the Beta simulator
      to start executing your code at the instruction labeled "STEP1:".  Then
      the array <tt>A</tt> is defined, occupying 12 words in memory and the value
      of the symbol <tt>ALEN</tt> is set to the length of <tt>A</tt>.</p>

      <pre class="jsim">.include "beta.uasm"

        BR(STEP1)   // start execution with Step 1

        // the array to be sorted
A:      LONG(10) LONG(56) LONG(27) LONG(69) LONG(73) LONG(99)
        LONG(44) LONG(36) LONG(10) LONG(72) LONG(71) LONG(1)

ALEN = (. - A)/4    // determine number of elements in A

// Please enter your code for each of the steps below...

STEP1:
        ...
STEP2:
        ...
STEP3:
        ...
STEP4:
        ...
STEP5:
        ...

// When step 5 is complete, execution continues with the
// checkoff code.  You must include this code in order to
// receive credit for completing the problem.
.include "checkoff.uasm"</pre>

      <p>Figure out the appropriate Beta instructions to use to complete each
      of the five steps described above.  There are some notes below, which you
      may find helpful.  To test your code, click the <button>Assemble</button>
      and correct any syntax errors reported by the assembler.  If assembly
      succeeds, you'll be switched from the Editor window to the Simulation window.</p>

      <p>You can use the simulation controls to step through your program one
      instruction at a time (<span class="fa fa-step-forward"></span>), execute
      instructions at a steady pace (<span class="fa fa-play"></span>), or execute
      instructions very rapidly (<span class="fa fa-fast-forward"></span>).  You
      can see the values in each register and memory location, so it's pretty easy
      to figure out if your code is doing what you expect!</p>

      <p>Executing one instruction at a time might be a good way to debug
      your code for the first pass or so.  Once your code completes, execution
      continues with the checkoff code, which uses the console pane in the simulator
      to report success or provide an error diagnostic.  The checkoff code must
      complete execution to receive credit for the lab.</p>

      <p>Good luck!</p>

      <p><b>Notes</b></p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li>It's convenient to use registers hold the value for often-used variables,
        e.g., <tt>i</tt> and <tt>swapped</tt>.  You can make your code easier to read
        by assigning appropriate names to the registers you've chosen to use to hold
        various values.  Simply add the following assembly language statements to
        your program:
        <pre class="jsim">i = R0        // use R0 to hold the value of i
swapped = R1  // use R1 to hold the value of swapped</pre></li>

        <li> To load the 16-bit two's complement constant 1234 into, say, R3, you can use
        the instruction <tt>ADDC(R31,1234,R3)</tt>.  This is a common operation so
        there's an abbreviation we can use: <tt>CMOVE(1234,R3)</tt>.
        For example, to load 0 into the register with the name <tt>swapped</tt>:
        <pre class="jsim">CMOVE(0,swapped)   // assumes we used Note 1</pre></li>

        <li> Most of the time we want to discard the PC+4 written by the branch
        instructions into the destination register, so we'll specify R31 as the destination.
        This is pretty common, so there's abbreviation we can use: instead of writing
        <tt>BEQ(r2,STEP5,r31)</tt>, we can write <tt>BEQ(r2,STEP5)</tt> and the assembler
        will supply R31 as the destination register.</li>

        <li> If you want a branch instruction that always branches, you can write
        <tt>BEQ(R31,STEP3)</tt> and since R31 always reads as 0, the test succeeds and
        the branch is taken.  There's an abbreviation we can use: <tt>BR(STEP3)</tt>,
        which assembler expands into <tt>BEQ(R31,STEP3)</tt>.</li>

        <li> To load the i<sup>th</sup> element of array <tt>A</tt> into
        a register, first compute the byte address of the array element and then
        use the <tt>LD</tt> instruction to fetch the desired value.  The byte address
        of the first (i.e., zeroth) element of array <tt>A</tt> is the value
        of the symbol <tt>A</tt>.  Each 32-bit value in the array occupies a
        32-bit word, or 4 bytes.  So we multiply <tt>i</tt> by 4 to
        convert from the array index to the appropriate byte offset from the
        beginning of the array.  We can then use the address arithmetic built into
        the <tt>LD</tt> instruction to combine the value of the symbol <tt>A</tt>
        with the byte offset of the element we want:

        <pre class="jsim">MULC(R0,4,R2) // i in R0, convert index into byte offset
// load address is Reg[Ra] + sxt(16-bit) literal
LD(R2,A,R3)   // loads A[i]
LD(R2,A-4,R4) // loads A[i-1]</pre></li>
