      <p><b>Instructions</b></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Copy your Beta modules from the "Building the Beta" exercise into the design
          project workspace:</li>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>Open up
            <a href="../lab7_beta/lab.html" target="_blank">Lab 7: Building the Beta</a>
            and scroll down to the
            Jade window in Problem 3.  In the module toolbar at the top of the
            Jade window, click on <span class="fa fa-fw fa-download"> </span>
            to copy your /alu and /beta modules onto the module clipboard.</li>

          <li>Returning to the Jade instance for the design project, in
            the module toolbar below, click on <span class="fa fa-fw fa-upload"> </span>,
            which will pop up a window to let you select
            which modules to copy into the current workspace.  Select all the
            /alu and /beta modules and click "OK", which will add the selected modules to
            your parts bin.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>The top-level module in the Design Project is /project/test,
          which initially has an instance of your /beta/beta and a 3-port main
          memory containing the benchmark code.  Your job is to optimize your
          Beta design as described below, possibly modifying the top-level
          module, e.g., to reduce the number of ports in the Main memory.</li>

        <li>Each time you make an improvement, use the
          <span class="fa fa-f fa-check" style="color:green"></span> tool to run the
          simulation and verify your Beta is still working correctly.  In the
          plot window click <button>Stats</button> to see your current Benmark
          (see below), which is used to compute your score.
          Running the simulation will save your work on the server and
          register your current score.  You can submit as often as you'd like
          and the server will keep track of your best design to date.</li>
        
      </ol>

      <p>NOTE: the goal is to keep the original functionality as you do
        your optimizations -- your optimized Beta should be able to run any
        legitimate Beta program.  Lobotomizing your Beta isn't kosher and the
        checkoff code tests that each instruction is implemented and that
        illegal instructions do, in fact, generate ILLOP traps.  So, for
        example, even though the IRQ input is tied to 0 in /project/test, you
        shouldn't delete the circuitry associated handling interrupt requests.</p>

      <div class="hint">
        Hint: It's good to keep copies of your modules as you go along.  <i>Before</i>
        modifying a module, use the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-copy"></span> tool in
        the module toolbar at the top of the Jade instance to make a copy of the
        currently selected module.  Use a simple naming scheme, e.g., <tt>/beta/beta_v1</tt>,
        <tt>/beta/beta_v2</tt>, ..., to keep track of different versions of a module.
        You'll be glad to have these back-up copies!

        <p>Note that the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-copy"></span> tool will
          select the copy for editing, so if your copy is intended to be the
          archived version, you'll need to reselect the original module and
          edit that.</p>
      </div>

      <p><b>Project Description</b></p>

      <p>For this project we're asking you to optimize the
        price/performance of your Beta design.  The "price" is determined from
        the area of your circuit as reported by JSim at the end of each
        simulation run (it reports the size in square microns when you
        click <button>Stats</button> in the simulation pane).  The
        "performance" is determined by the time needed to complete a set of
        benchmark programs.  Benchmarking is the traditional, if somewhat
        unreliable, way of characterizing processor performance.</p>

      <p>The benchmark suite can be found in the second Appendix below;
        in addition to a short functional test, it includes four benchmarks:

        <ul>

          <li>Benchmark #1 makes two calls to a subroutine that performs an
            unsigned divide of its arguments, and then stores the quotients and
            remainders in main memory.</li>

          <li>Benchmark #2 makes two subroutine calls: one to do an
            in-place reverse an 11-element list, the second to compare the
            reversed list with an "answer" list to see if all went well.</li>

          <li>Benchmark #3 makes a copy of itself further up in memory and
            then jumps to the first location of the copy. The process is repeated
            2 times.</li>

          <li>Benchmark #4 just performs a lot of register arithmetic and
            writes the result to memory -- should be a slam dunk for pipelined and
            superscalar machines.</li>

        </ul>

      <p>See the benchmark suite for details about what values are written by
        each benchmark.  The checkoff tests require 1104 cycles to execute on a
        standard unpipelined Beta.  The test initially uses a clock period of 100ns,
        giving your Beta plenty of time to run each cycle.  As you improve your
        design you'll shorten the clock period to reflect the propagation of your
        circuitry with the goal of running the benchmark as
        fast as possible, which will maximize your score.</p>

      <p>Since your optimized design may operate differently than the Beta
        described in the Lab handouts, the test in the TEST tab is a little
        different than the others we've seen so far this semester.  The test
        only supplies a RESET signal (high during the first cycle, low
        afterwards) and sets the clock period.  The test is set up to run 1104
        cycles, after which the test checks certain locations of this memory
        to see that the benchmark has completed successfully.  If your design
        passes verification, you can submit it to the on-line checkoff system
        to record the number of points your design has received.  The points
        are determined by the following formula:</p>

      <center>
        Benmark = 1e-10/(&lt; ending simulation time in seconds &gt; * &lt; size in meter<sup>2</sup> &gt; )<br/>
        Points = round(Benmark)/2  [min = 0, max = 20]<br/>
        <br/>
      </center>

      <p>The smaller your circuit and the shorter the time it takes to
        complete the simulation, the better the Benmark.  A good Beta design
        completed as described in the Lab 7 handout has a Benmark of 15 or
        more (depending on various design choices) and would receive a few
        points if submitted.  Earning 10 points on the design project is very
        doable.  Earning 15 points is within reach but will require close
        attention to all the details listed in the Hints section
        below. Earning all 20 points will require insight and a
        considerable investment of time.</p>

      <p><b>Your first step</b> should be to load your current Beta design
        as described above, and then verify that your
        Beta design can complete the benchmark successfully.  You may find that
        the benchmark code triggers some bug in your original Beta design that
        was not detected by the Beta checkoff code -- you'll need to track down
        down and fix the problems before starting in on optimizations.  [If you
        discover such a case, let us know so we can fix the Beta tests... thanks!]</p>

      <p><b>Your second step</b> should be to adjust the clock period down
        from the default value of 100ns.  See #1 in the "Hints for speed" below.
        This will give you an accurate Benmark for your Lab 7 design.</p>

      <p>Good luck! Don't be discouraged if your design doesn't earn a zillion points
        on the first try -- it takes some practice to get the knack of making
        circuits both fast and small.  If you achieve a great Benmark, let us
        know and come join the 6.004 staff :)</p>

      <p><b>Hints for size</b></p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li> The biggest single size reduction comes from eliminating one
          port on the multi-port main memory by combining the read and write
          data ports, multiplexing a single 32-bit bus between read and write
          data (we'll never need both in the same cycle!).  Use tristate drivers
          to send write data to the memory's data pins (the memory has these
          built-in for sending data back to the processor -- that's what the MOE
          signal has been controlling).  The write-up for the Standard Cell library has more
          documentation for the <tt>memory</tt> component.</li>

        <li>Design an incrementer circuit for adding 4 to the PC instead
          of using a regular 2-input adder.  This is easy to do -- just think
          about an adder where the second input is the constant 4 (i.e., all but
          one of the input bits is zero!) and then eliminate/simplify the adder
          logic appropriately.</li>

        <li>Design a shifter unit that uses a single circuit with seven
          32-bit shifters to implement both left and right shifts.  You can do
          this because, for example, a right shift can be implemented as a left
          shift by bit-reversing <tt>A[31:0]</tt> on the way in, and bit-reversing the
          answer on the way out.  "Bit reverse" means simply flipping the 32-word
          end-for-end -- we want to shift <tt>A[0:31]</tt> instead of <tt>A[31:0]</tt>.</li>

        <li>Use logic gates instead of a ROM to generate some of the
          control signals, <i>e.g.</i>, <tt>RA2SEL</tt> which is needed early in
          each cycle before the register file can be accessed.  You can get some
          space saving by eliminating a CTL ROM output, but it's not huge and your
          time is probably better spent on other optimizations.  The main benefit
          of this optimization is a speed improvement for timing critical signals.</li>

      </ol>

      <p><b>Hints for speed</b></p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li><i>Determine your minimum clock cycle.</i> Here's a recipe:</li>

        <ol type="a">

          <li>Look at min observed setup time reported when you click the
            <button>Stats</button> after simulation completes. Say it says
            72.123ns -- this is the amount of time by which you can shorted your
            clock cycle. We don't recommend trying to shave it too close -- in
            this case one could shave maybe 72ns from the clock cycle, reducing
            the clock period to 28ns. Note that this number is related to the
            actual code and data of the benchmark code and the cycle time you can
            get away with will be smaller than reported by timing analysis, which
            is computing the worst-case t<sub>PD</sub>. In real life, your boss
            will make you use the worst-case number!</li>

          <li>Adjust the timing of the clock period as specified
            in the TEST tab.  The original clock period of 100ns is set by
            this line in the TEST tab:

          <p><nobr><tt>.cycle CLK=1 tran 1n assert inputs tran 49ns CLK=0 tran 50n</tt></nobr></p>

          <p>where CLK=1 for 50ns and CLK=0 for 50ns of each test cycle. The
            <tt>assert inputs</tt> command sets time in each cycle when the RESET
            input will change to its value for the cycle.  In this case, that
            happens 1ns after the rising clock edge.</p>

          <p>To shorten the clock period to 28ns, simply adjust the timing for
            each phase of the clock, keeping the 50% duty cycle:</p>

          <p><nobr><tt>.cycle CLK=1 tran 1n assert inputs tran 13ns CLK=0 tran 14n</tt></nobr></p>
          </li>

          <li>Assuming that you haven't made any modifications that change
            the number of cycles the benchmark takes to run, you can simply leave
            the <tt>.repeat 1104</tt> as is. If you change the number of cycles
            (<i>e.g.</i>, by adding branch delay slots with a 2-stage pipeline)
            then you'll need to look at the plotted waveforms to determine at
            which cycle you reach the end of the benchmark.</li>

        </ol>

        <li><i>minimize load-dependent delays</i>.  As you connect the
          output of a gate to additional inputs, its capacitance increases and
          so changes in the signal value take longer (see the tR and tF columns
          in the standard cell documentation).  Heavily loaded signals should be
          buffered to reduce the total delay.  There is a high-drive buffer (the
          icon with the "H") available for driving
          large loads.  Use the timing analyzer (click on the icon
          with a gate and a little clock) and look for signals in the critical
          path where the delay is greater than 1ns -- those signals are slow
          because they are driving many signals, so adding buffers can help
          speed things up.

          <p>It pays to be clever about buffering.  For example <tt>id[15]</tt>
            is heavily loaded since it's used many times during sign-extension for 
            the <tt>BSEL</tt> mux and for the offset adder in the PC module.  But
            it's also an address input to the register file, which we want to be fast
            since the register-file access is on the critical timing path.  So it's
            best to leave the register-file input connected to <tt>id[15]</tt> while
            also creating a buffered version <tt>buf_id[15]</tt> and then using <tt>buf_id[15]</tt>
            for the <tt>BSEL</tt> mux and the PC logic.  The heavy loads are now driven
            separately from the register-file input, i.e., there's a fast version of the
            signal and a slow version.</p>
        </li>

        <li><i>use inverting logic</i>.  NAND, NOR, etc. gates are noticeably
          faster than their non-inverting counterparts (AND, OR, ...).
          Rearranging logic to use inverting gates can make a big difference
          performance along the critical path of your circuit.  Positive logic
          gates are included in the standard cell library because they are often
          smaller than their inverting logic equivalents and thus may be useful
          for implementing logic that is not on the critical path.</li>

        <li><i>minimize delay along critical paths</i>.  Look at the device and
          cycle for which the minimum observed setup was reported when you clicked
          <button>Stats</button>. By tracing back through the
          circuitry that lead to this critical path you should get some good
          ideas about where your circuit could use a speed boost.  It's often
          possible to rearrange your logic to reduce the number of gate delays
          along the critical path, sometimes at the cost of additional gates
          elsewhere but that's a tradeoff which is often worthwhile.</li>

        <li>use a faster adder architecture for the ALU and branch-offset
          adder.  Consider using an architecture that avoids rippling the carry
          through all 32 bits of the adder: carry-select and carry-lookahead are
          two techniques that are described in more detail in the Appendix below.</li>

        <li><i>reorganize instruction fetch</i>.  In a single cycle, an
          unpipelined Beta can make up to two accesses to the relatively slow
          main memory (4ns access time for the SRAM-sized memory we've been
          using).  Worse yet, the two accesses are in series: first we access
          the memory to fetch the current instruction, then a second access is
          needed for the data if the Beta is executing a LD, LDR or ST.

          <p>With a little reorganization, we can get the two accesses to
            happen in parallel!  The trick is to fetch the next instruction at the
            end of the current cycle (overlapping with the data access, if any).
            The time for fetching the instruction is no longer needed at the
            beginning of the cycle, allowing you to cut almost 4ns from your cycle
            time.  Here's a diagram showing the necessary modifications:</p>

          <center><img src="project_1.png" width="500"/></center>

          <div class="hint">
            Hint: you'll need to add a new terminal to your PC module.  To do this,
            select the ICON tab for the PC module, click on the terminal tool
            (<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
              <circle cx="5" cy="10" r="3" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
              <path d="M 5 10 h 8" stroke="black" fill="transparent"/>
            </svg>),
            then click on the diagram to add a new terminal.  Edit the terminal's
            NAME property, giving it the name of the internal signal you want
            accessible to user's of the PC module.   If you want it to match
            the other terminals, use the text tool (<span class="fa fa-fw fa-font"></span>)
            to add a text label that will be visible to designers when they're
            looking at the PC module's icon in their schematics.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>A two-stage pipeline (instruction fetch and
          everything else) can come close to cutting the cycle time in half.  A
          pipelined design is fun but a lot of work, so try the other hints
          first.

          <p>If you're working on a two-stage pipeline, start by implementing
            the simple 2-stage pipeline shown below:</p>

          <center><img src="project_2.png" width="600"/></center>

          <p>The <tt>annul_if</tt> signal should be 1 when <tt>reset=1</tt> or
            when <tt>pcsel[2:0]!=0</tt>, which happens when we're changing the PC
            from sequential execution.  Get this working first -- it won't be
            faster, but it sets the stage for a speed improvement in the next
            step.</p>

          <p>In the second step, we want to have LD/LDR/ST take two cycles in
            the EXE stage: we'll compute the address in the first cycle and do the
            memory access in the second cycle.  Let's call these two cycles MEM1
            and MEM2.  You'll need to convert the PC_IF, PC_EXE and IR_EXE
            registers to load-enabled registers (see Slide 6 of L14); the load
            enable should be hooked to <tt>not_stall</tt>.  And you'll need to add
            a register that holds the memory address between the output of the ALU
            and main memory.</p>

          <ul>
            <li> During MEM1, we need to generate a <tt>stall</tt> signal which, inverted
              to create <tt>not_stall</tt>, will stall the IF and EXE stages, ensuring that
              LD/LDR/ST will get two exe cycles.  You should add some logic to ensure WR = 0
              during MEM1, even when the current instruction is ST (we'll do the actual write
              during MEM2).  The memory address from the ALU is loaded into the new memory
              address register at the end of MEM1.  Make sure <tt>stall</tt> is 0 during reset.</li>

            <li>During MEM2, the memory will use the address calculated during MEM1
              to perform the requested memory operation.  <tt>stall</tt> should be 0 during
              MEM2, so that normal execution will resume in the next cycle.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Now that the ALU and main memory operations are in different clock cycles,
          your clock cycle time should be noticeably smaller.</p>
          
          <p>Here's a <A href="../beta2.pdf" target="_blank">two-stage
              pipelined Beta</A> that uses a slightly different scheme than the one
            described above and has many additional optimizations, earning a
            Benmark of 54.  This version takes a lot of effort to debug, so be
            aware that implementing this design will take some time.</p>

      <p><b>Appendix: Faster adders</b></p>

      <p>Our simple ripple-carry adder is quite slow and we can cut many
        nanoseconds off the cycle time by using an adder architecture that
        doesn't require the carry to travel through 32 stages of logic.
        Some good alternatives:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><i>Carry-select adder</i> (see
          <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-select_adder" target="_blank">
          article on Wikipedia</A>).  Basic idea: do two
          additions for the high half of the bits, one assuming the carry-in is
          0, the other assuming the carry-in is 1.  Use a MUX to select the
          appropriate answers when the correct carry-in from the low half is
          known. 
          The Design Tradeoffs lecture has some additional design hints for carry-select
          adders.</li>

        <li><i>Carry-lookahead adder</i> (see the Design Tradeoffs lecture).
          Basic idea: we can compute the
          carry-in for each bit using a tree of lookahead modules, resulting in
          a t<sub>PD</sub> that grows logarithmically with the size of the
          inputs instead of linearly.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><b>Appendix: Test program</b></p>

      <p>The BSim instance below shows the Beta program used to test the
        functionality of your improved Beta.  You may find it useful
        to compare the cycle-by-cycle operation of your circuit with the
        cycle-by-cycle execution of the test program in the BSim simulator.
        Note that any changes you make below (e.g., adding breakpoints) will
        not be saved when leaving this window.</p>
