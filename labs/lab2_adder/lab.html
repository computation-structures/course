      <h3>Problem 1. CMOS basics</h3>

      <p>The following questions are multiple-choice.  You can, of
      course, simply keep guessing until you get the right answer.  But
      you'll be in a much better position to take the quizzes if you take
      the time to actually figure out the answers.</p>

      <ol type="A">

        <li>
        If we set the inputs of a particular CMOS gate to voltages that
        correspond to valid logic levels, we would expect the <i>static</i>
        power dissipation of the gate to be</li>
        <answer type="choice" id="5A">
          <choice> essentially zero </choice>
          <choice> depends on whether output voltage is low or high </choice>
          <choice> unknown with the facts given </choice>
        </answer>
        <li>
        Measuring a particular CMOS device G, we find 1.5V noise margins.
        If the <i>width</i> of all mosfets inside of G were doubled, we
        would expect the noise margins of the new gate to</li>
        <answer type="choice" id="5B">
          <choice> stay about the same </choice>
          <choice> increase noticeably </choice>
          <choice> decrease noticeably </choice>
          <choice> change noticeably, but can't tell which way </choice>
        </answer>
        <li>
        To <i>decrease</i> the output rise time of a CMOS gate one could</li>

          <choice> increase the width of all nfets </choice>
          <choice> none of the above </choice>
        </answer>

        <li>
        The Boolean function F(A,B,C,D) of four inputs is implemented
        as a single CMOS gate whose output connects to a pullup circuit
        containing only PFETs and a pulldown containing only NFETs.  The output
        of F is known to depend on its inputs; i.e., F(A,B,C,D) is zero for
        certain input combinations and one for others. What can you deduce
        about F(1,1,1,1)?</li>
        <answer type="choice" id="5D">
          <label> F(1,1,1,1) will be </label>

        </answer>
      </ol>

      <h3>Problem 2. Power dissipation</h3>

      <p>Almost all of the power dissipated by CMOS circuits goes into charging
      and discharging nodal capacitances.  This power can be computed as
      \(CV^2F\) where \(C\) is the capacitance being
      switched, \(V\) is the change in voltage, and \(F\) is the
      frequency at which the switching happens.  In CMOS circuits, nodes
      are switched between ground (0 volts) and the power supply voltage
      (\(V_{DD}\) volts), so \(V\) is either +\(V_{DD}\) (for a 0&rarr;1 output transition)
      or \(-V_{DD}\) (for a 1&rarr;0 output transition) and so
      \(V^2 = V_{DD}^2\).</p>

      <query>
        Suppose we have a device implemented in a technology where \(V_{DD}\) = 5V.
        If we have the option of reimplementing the device in a technology
        where \(V_{DD} = 3.3V\), what sort of speedup (i.e., change in <b>F</b>) could
        be specified for the reimplementation
        assuming we want to keep the power budget unchanged?
      </query>
      <answer type="number" id="6">
        <label>Speedup (e.g., 2.0 would be twice as fast)</label>
        <placeholder>&pm;5%</placeholder>
      </answer>

      <h3>Problem 3. CMOS logic gates</h3>

      <p>As we saw in lecture, there are 16 possible 2-input combinational
      logic gates.  The cost of implementing these gates varies
      dramatically, requiring somewhere between 0 and 10 mosfets depending
      on the gate.  For example, it takes 2 mosfets to implement
      "F = NOT A", but 4 mosfets (organized as two inverters) to
      implement "F = A".</p>

      <p>For each of the 2-input gates whose Karnaugh maps are given
        below, indicate the minimum number of mosfets required to implement
        the gate.  You should only consider static fully-complementary
        circuits like those shown in lecture; these implementations meet the
        following criteria:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>no static power dissipation</li>
          <li>\(V_{OL} = 0V\), \(V_{OH}\) = power supply voltage</li>
          <li>NFETs appear only in pulldown circuits, PFETs appear only in pullup circuits</li>
          <li>the pullup and pulldown are complementary, i.e., when one path is "on", the other is "off"</li>
          <li>the pullup and pulldown circuits can be decomposed into series and parallel connections of mosfets</li>
          <li>all gate implementations restore incoming logic levels (so a wire connecting an input terminal to an output terminal would not be a legal gate implementation)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problem 4.  Design Problem: 3-bit adder</h3>

      <p>Your mission is to design and test a CMOS circuit that
      performs addition of two two's-complement 3-bit numbers, producing a 4-bit
      result:<p>

      <p><center><img src="10.png"/></center></p>

      <p><b>Ripple-carry adders</b></p>

      <p>Let's start with a simple ripple-carry adder based on the
      full-adder module, which has 3 inputs (\(A\), \(B\) and \(C_{IN}\))
      and 2 outputs (\(S\) and \(C_{OUT}\)).  The full adder computes the
      sum of \(A\), \(B\) and \(C_{IN}\) and outputs the 2-bit answer on
      \(C_{OUT}\) and \(S\).  The logic equations and truth table for \(S\)
      and \(C_{OUT}\) are shown below.</p>

      $$S = A \oplus B \oplus C_{IN} \qquad C_{OUT}=A\cdot B + A\cdot C_{IN} + B\cdot C_{IN}$$

      <style>
        .truth-table th {
            text-align: center;
            border-bottom: 1px solid black;
        }
        .truth-table td {
            text-align: center;
        }
        .truth-table .br {
            border-right: 1px solid black;
        }
      </style>

      <p><center><table class="truth-table">
          <tr><th>\(A\)</th><th>\(B\)</th><th class="br">\(C_{IN}\)</th><th>\(S\)</th><th>\(C_{OUT}\)</th></tr>
          <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="br">0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
          <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td class="br">1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>

          <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td class="br">0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td class="br">1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
      </table></center></p>

      <p>A ripple-carry adder is simply a chain of full adder modules that compute
      the sum bit-by-bit, like so:</p>

      <p><center><img src="13.png" width="500"/></center></p>

      <p>There are three goals for your implementation.  First, of course,
      is computing the right outputs.  The other two goals involve some
      engineering tradeoffs: small circuit size, as measured by the total
      number of mosfets, and fast performance, as measured by the
      \(t_{PD}\) of the ADDER3 circuit.  In ripple-carry adders, the
      longest path is through the carry chain that connects the full adder
      (FA) modules, i.e., through the \(C_{IN}\) to
      \(C_{OUT}\) path of each FA module in turn.  So try to minimize
      the \(t_{PD}\) of the logic that computes \(C_{OUT}\).</p>

      <p>Typically \(S\) is implemented using two cascaded 2-input XOR gates.
      You can use ANDs and ORs in a sum-of-products implementation for \(C_{out}\),
      but for speed think about using three 2-input NANDs and one 3-input
      NAND to implement \(C_{out}\) (remember that by Demorgan's Law two cascaded
      NANDs are logically equivalent to a cascade of AND/OR).</p>

      <p><b>Build your own gate library</b></p>

      <p>Since we're using individual gates to implement the logic, a good
      place to start is to build your own gate library (e.g., inverter,
      2-input NAND, 2-input XOR, ...), test them individually, and
      then use them to implement your design.  It's much easier to debug
      your circuit module-by-module rather than as one big lump.  XOR
      can be a challenging gate to design; here's one suggestion for how it
      might be implemented based on the observation that \(\textrm{XOR}(A,B)\) is
      true when \(A\) and \(B\) are <i>not</i> \(11\) or \(00\):</p>

      $$\textrm{XOR}(A,B) = \overline{A\cdot B + \overline{A}\cdot\overline{B}} = 
      \overline{A\cdot B + \overline{A + B}} = \overline{A\cdot B + \textrm{NOR}(A,B)}$$

      <p><center><img src="14.png" width="500"/></center></p>

      <p>The large, black "connection dots" in the
      schematic show where crossing signal wires connect.  In the figure
      above, the output of the NOR2 gate connects to the gate of the PFET
      then goes on to connect to the gate of the
      NFET at the bottom right.  It crosses over but does not connect to
      the Z wire.  The triangle symbol at the bottom is a connection to
      ground; the T-shaped symbol at the top is a connection to \(V_{DD}\).</p>

      <p>We've provided skeleton modules for most of the logic gates &mdash;
      each module includes a schematic icon and a functional test, but
      you'll need to build the schematic for any gates you use in your design.
      We've provided schematics for the inverter and for the AND and OR gates,
      which are built using the corresponding NAND and NOR gates.</p>

      <p>Suggested steps:</p>

      <ol type="1">

        <li>Select the "/adder/fa" module using the module selection box at
        the top.  Design the circuit you'll use to implement the FA functionality
        then click and drag the gates needed from the parts bin on the right into
        your schematic.  Arrange the gates and input/output ports tastefully,
        then add wires to make the appropriate connections.</li>

        <li>Enter a schematic for each logic gate you used in Step 1:
        select 
        the appropriate module, then drag NFETs and PFETs from the
        parts bin into the schematic to build a CMOS implementation of the
        gate.  You can click and drag the icons for ground and \(V_{DD}\)
        from the toolbar at the top of the schematic to make connections
        for the pulldowns and pullups.  Remember to hook up the input/output ports.
        Take a look at the /adder/inverter module to see what a finished
        gate schematic looks like.

        <p>Now click the green checkmark in the toolbar in order to run
          the test to verify that you've correctly implemented the gate.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Once all the necessary logic gates have been designed and
        verified, return to the /adder/fa module and verify its implementation
        by clicking on the green checkmark.</li>

        <li>After your FA implementation is correct, select the /adder/adder3
        module and click the green checkmark to verify correct operation of
        the ADDER3 module and complete the design task.
        Since this is a large circuit, the simulation will take awhile &mdash;
        be patient!  When this simulation completes successfully, the system
        will give you credit for completing this design problem.</li>
