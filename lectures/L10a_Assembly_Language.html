<h2>Review: Beta ISA</h2>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide2.png"/></p>

<p>In the previous lecture, we developed the instruction set
architecture for the Beta, the computer system we&#700;ll be
building throughout this part of the course.  The Beta
incorporates two types of storage or memory.  In the CPU
datapath there are 32 general-purpose registers, which can be
read to supply source operands for the ALU or written with the
ALU result.  In the CPU&#700;s control logic there is a
special-purpose register called the program counter, which
contains the address of the memory location holding the next
instruction to be executed.</p>

<p>The datapath and control logic are connected to a large main
memory with a maximum capacity of $2^{32}$ bytes, organized as
$2^{30}$ 32-bit words.  This memory holds both data and
instructions.</p>

<p>Beta instructions are 32-bit values comprised of various
fields.  The 6-bit OPCODE field specifies the operation to be
performed.  The 5-bit Ra, Rb, and Rc fields contain register
numbers, specifying one of the 32 general-purpose registers.
There are two instruction formats: one specifying an opcode and
three registers, the other specifying an opcode, two registers,
and a 16-bit signed constant.</p>

<p>There three classes of instructions.  The ALU instructions
perform an arithmetic or logic operation on two operands,
producing a result that is stored in the destination register.
The operands are either two values from the general-purpose
registers, or one register value and a constant.  The yellow
highlighting indicates instructions that use the second
instruction format.</p>

<p>The Load/Store instructions access main memory, either loading
a value from main memory into a register, or storing a register
value to main memory.</p>

<p>And, finally, there are branches and jumps whose execution may
change the program counter and hence the address of the next
instruction to be executed.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide3.png"/></p>

<p>To program the Beta we&#700;ll need to load main memory with
binary-encoded instructions.  Figuring out each encoding is
clearly the job for a computer, so we&#700;ll create a simple
programming language that will let us specify the opcode and
operands for each instruction.  So instead of writing the binary
at the top of slide, we&#700;ll write assembly language
statements to specify instructions in symbolic form.  Of course
we still have think about which registers to use for which
values and write sequences of instructions for more complex
operations.</p>

<p>By using a high-level language we can move up one more level
abstraction and describe the computation we want in terms of
variables and mathematical operations rather than registers and
ALU functions.</p>

<p>In this lecture, we&#700;ll describe the assembly language
we&#700;ll use for programming the Beta.  And in the next
lecture we&#700;ll figure out how to translate high-level
languages, such as C, into assembly language.</p>

<p>The layer cake of abstractions gets taller yet: we could write
an interpreter for say, Python, in C and then write our
application programs in Python.  Nowadays, programmers often
choose the programming language that&#700;s most suitable for
expressing their computations, then, after perhaps many layers
of translation, come up with a sequence of instructions that the
Beta can actually execute.</p>

<h2>Assembly Language</h2>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide4.png"/></p>

<p>Okay, back to assembly language, which we&#700;ll use to
shield ourselves from the bit-level representations of
instructions and from having to know the exact location of
variables and instructions in memory.  A program called the
<i>assembler</i> reads a text file containing the
assembly language program and produces an array of 32-bit words
that can be used to initialize main memory.</p>

<p>We&#700;ll learn the UASM assembly language, which is built
into BSim, our simulator for the Beta ISA.  UASM is really just
a fancy calculator!  It reads arithmetic expressions and
evaluates them to produce 8-bit values, which it then adds
sequentially to the array of bytes which will eventually be
loaded into the Beta&#700;s memory.  UASM supports several
useful language features that make it easier to write assembly
language programs.  Symbols and labels let us give names to
particular values and addresses.  And macros let us create
shorthand notations for sequences of expressions that, when
evaluated, will generate the binary representations for
instructions and data.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide5.png"/></p>

<p>Here&#700;s an example UASM source file.  Typically we write
one UASM statement on each line and can use spaces, tabs and
newlines to make the source as readable as possible.
We&#700;ve added some color coding to help in our
explanation.</p>

<p>Comments (shown in green) allow us to add text annotations to
the program.  Good comments will help remind you how your
program works.  You really don&#700;t want to have figure out
from scratch what a section of code does each time you need to
modify or debug it!  There are two ways to add comments to the
code.  &#8220;//&#8221; starts a comment, which then occupies
the rest of the source line.  Any characters after
&#8220;//&#8221; are ignored by the assembler, which will start
processing statements again at the start of the next line in the
source file.  You can also enclose comment text using the
delimiters &#8220;/*&#8221; and &#8220;*/&#8221; and the
assembler will ignore everything in-between.  Using this second
type of comment, you can <i>comment-out</i> many lines of
code by placing &#8220;/*&#8221; at the start and, many lines
later, end the comment section with &#8220;*/&#8221;.</p>

<p>Symbols (shown in red) are symbolic names for constant values.
Symbols make the code easier to understand, <i>e.g.</i>, we can
use N as the name for an initial value for some computation, in
this case the value 12.  Subsequent statements can refer to this
value using the symbol N instead of entering the value 12
directly.  When reading the program, we&#700;ll know that N
means this particular initial value.  So if later we want to
change the initial value, we only have to change the definition
of the symbol N rather than find all the 12&#700;s in our
program and change them.  In fact some of the other appearances
of 12 might not refer to this initial value and so to be sure we
only changed the ones that did, we&#700;d have to read and
understand the whole program to make sure we only edited the
right 12&#700;s.  You can imagine how error-prone that might
be!  So using symbols is a practice you want to follow!</p>

<p>Note that all the register names are shown in red.  We&#700;ll
define the symbols R0 through R31 to have the values 0 through
31.  Then we&#700;ll use those symbols to help us understand
which instruction operands are intended to be
registers, <i>e.g.</i>, by writing R1, and which operands are
numeric values, <i>e.g.</i>, by writing the number 1.  We could
just use numbers everywhere, but the code would be much harder
to read and understand.</p>

<p>Labels (shown in yellow) are symbols whose value are the
address of a particular location in the program.  Here, the
label &#8220;loop&#8221; will be our name for the location of
the MUL instruction in memory.  In the BNE at the end of the
code, we use the label &#8220;loop&#8221; to specify the MUL
instruction as the branch target.  So if R1 is non-zero, we want
to branch back to the MUL instruction and start another
iteration.</p>

<p>We&#700;ll use indentation for most UASM statements to make it
easy to spot the labels defined by the program.  Indentation
isn&#700;t required, it&#700;s just another habit assembly
language programmers use to keep their programs readable.</p>

<p>We use macro invocations (shown in blue) when we want to write
Beta instructions.  When the assembler encounters a macro, it
<i>expands</i> the macro, replacing it with a string of
text provided by in the macro&#700;s definition.  During
expansion, the provided arguments are textually inserted into
the expanded text at locations specified in the macro
definition.  Think of a macro as shorthand for a longer text
string we could have typed in.  We&#700;ll see how all this
works in the next video segment.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide6.png"/></p>

<p>Let&#700;s follow along as the assembler processes our source
file.  The assembler maintains a symbol table that maps symbols
names to their numeric values.  Initially the symbol table is
loaded with mappings for all the register symbols.</p>

<p>The assembler reads the source file line-by-line, defining
symbols and labels, expanding macros, or evaluating expressions
to generate bytes for the output array.  Whenever the assembler
encounters a use of a symbol or label, it&#700;s replaced by
the corresponding numeric value found in the symbol table.</p>

<p>The first line, N = 12, defines the value of the symbol N to be
12, so the appropriate entry is made in the symbol table.</p>

<p>Advancing to the next line, the assembler encounters an
invocation of the ADDC macro with the arguments
&#8220;r31&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8221;, and &#8220;r1&#8221;.  As
we&#700;ll see in a couple of slides, this triggers a series of
nested macro expansions that eventually lead to generating a
32-bit binary value to be placed in memory location 0.  The
32-bit value is formatted here to show the instruction fields
and the destination address is shown in brackets.</p>

<p>The next instruction is processed in the same way, generating a
second 32-bit word.</p>

<p>On the fourth line, the label loop is defined to have the value
of the location in memory that&#700;s about to filled (in this
case, location 8).  So the appropriate entry is made in the
symbol table and the MUL macro is expanded into the 32-bit word
to be placed in location 8.</p>

<p>The assembler processes the file line-by-line until it reaches
the end of the file.  Actually the assembler makes two passes
through the file.  On the first pass it loads the symbol table
with the values from all the symbol and label definitions.
Then, on the second pass, it generates the binary output.  The
two-pass approach allows a statement to refer to symbol or label
that is defined later in the file, <i>e.g.</i>, a forward branch
instruction could refer to the label for an instruction later in
the program.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide7.png"/></p>

<p>As we saw in the previous slide, there&#700;s nothing magic
about the register symbols &#8212; they are just symbolic names
for the values 0 through 31.  So when processing ADDC(r31,N,r1),
UASM replaces the symbols with their values and actually expands
ADDC(31,12,1).</p>

<p>UASM is very simple.  It simply replaces symbols with their
values, expands macros and evaluates expressions.  So if you use
a register symbol where a numeric value is expected, the value
of the symbol is used as the numeric constant.  Probably not
what the programmer intended.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you use a symbol or expression where a register
number is expected, the low-order 5 bits of the value is used as
the register number, in this example, as the Rb register number.
Again probably not what the programmer intended.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that when writing UASM assembly
language programs, you have to keep your wits about you and
recognize that the interpretation of an operand is determined by
the opcode macro, not by the way you wrote the operand.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide8.png"/></p>

<p>Recall from the previous lecture that branch instructions use
the 16-bit constant field of the instruction to encode the
address of the branch target as a word offset from the location
of the branch instruction.  Well, actually the offset is
calculated from the instruction immediately following the
branch, so an offset of -1 would refer to the branch itself.</p>

<p>The calculation of the offset is a bit tedious to do by hand
and would, of course, change if we added or removed instructions
between the branch instruction and branch target.  Happily
macros for the branch instructions incorporate the necessary
formula to compute the offset from the address of the branch and
the address of the branch target.  So we just specify the
address of the branch target, usually with a label, and let UASM
do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Here we see that BNE branches backwards by three instructions
(remember to count from the instruction following the branch) so
the offset is -3.  The 16-bit two&#700;s complement
representation of -3 is the value placed in the constant field
of the BNE instruction.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide9.png"/></p>

<p>Let&#700;s take a closer look at how macros work in UASM.
Here we see the definition of the macro &#8220;consec&#8221;
which has a single parameter &#8220;n&#8221;.  The body of the
macro is a sequence of four expressions.  When there&#700;s an
invocation of the &#8220;consec&#8221; macro, in this example
with the argument 37, the body of the macro is expanded
replacing all occurrences of &#8220;n&#8221; with the argument
37.  The resulting text is then processed as if it had appeared
in place of the macro invocation.  In this example, the four
expressions are evaluated to give a sequence of four values that
will be placed in the next four bytes of the output array.</p>

<p>Macro expansions may contain other macro invocations, which
themselves will be expanded, continuing until all that&#700;s
left are expressions to be evaluated.  Here we see the macro
definition for WORD, which assembles its argument into two
consecutive bytes.  And for the macro LONG, which assembles its
argument into four consecutive bytes, using the WORD macro to
process the low 16 bits of the value, then the high 16 bits of
the value.</p>

<p>These two UASM statements cause the constant 0xDEADBEEF to
converted to 4 bytes, which are deposited in the output array
starting at index 0x100.</p>

<p>Note that the Beta expects the least-significant byte of a
multi-byte value to be stored at the lowest byte address.  So
the least-significant byte 0xEF is placed at address 0x100 and
the most-significant byte 0xDE is placed at address 0x103.  This
is the <i>little-endian</i> convention for multi-byte
values: the least-significant byte comes first.  Intel&#700;s
x86 architecture is also little-endian.</p>

<p>There is a symmetrical <i>big-endian</i> convention
where the most-significant byte comes first. Both conventions
are in active use and, in fact, some ISAs can be configured to
use either convention!  There&#700;s no &#8220;right
answer&#8221; for which convention to use, but the fact that
there two conventions means that we have to be alert for the
need to convert the representation of multi-byte values when
moving values between one ISA and another, <i>e.g.</i>, when we
send a data file to another user.</p>

<p>As you can imagine there are strong advocates for both schemes
who are happy to defend their point of view at great length.
Given the heat of the discussion, it&#700;s appropriate that
the names for the conventions were drawn from Jonathan
Swift&#700;s &#8220;Gulliver&#700;s Travels&#8221; in which a
civil war is fought over whether to open a soft-boiled egg at
its big end or its little end.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide10.png"/></p>

<p>Let&#700;s look at the macros used to assemble Beta
instructions.  The BETAOP helper macro supports the 3-register
instruction format, taking as arguments the values to be placed
in the OPCODE, Ra, Rb, and Rc fields.  The &#8220;.align
4&#8221; directive is a bit of administrative bookkeeping to
ensure that instructions will have a byte address that&#700;s a
multiple of 4, <i>i.e.</i>, that they span exactly one 32-bit
word in memory.  That&#700;s followed by an invocation of the
LONG macro to generate the 4 bytes of binary data representing
the value of the expression shown here.  The expression is where
the actual assembly of the fields takes place.  Each field is
limited to requisite number of bits using the modulo operator
(%), then shifted left (&lt;&lt;) to the correct position in the
32-bit word.</p>

<p>And here are the helper macros for the instructions that use a
16-bit constant as the second operand.</p>

<p>Let&#700;s follow the assembly of an ADDC instruction to see
how this works.  The ADDC macro expands into an invocation of
the BETAOPC helper macro, passing along the correct value for
the ADDC opcode, along with the three operands.</p>

<p>The BETAOPC macro does the following arithmetic: The OP
argument, in this case the value 0x30, is shifted left to occupy
the high-order 6 bits of the instruction.  Then the RA argument,
in this case 15, is placed in its proper location.  The 16-bit
constant -32768 is positioned in the low 16 bits of the
instruction. And, finally, the Rc argument, in this case 0, is
positioned in the Rc field of the instruction.</p>

<p>You can see why we call this processing &#8220;assembling an
instruction&#8221;.  The binary representation of an instruction
is assembled from the binary values for each of the instruction
fields.  It&#700;s not a complicated process, but it requires a
lot of shifting and masking, tasks that we&#700;re happy to let
a computer handle.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide11.png"/></p>

<p>Here&#700;s the entire sequence of macro expansions that
assemble this ADDC instruction into an appropriate 32-bit binary
value in main memory.</p>

<p>You can see that the knowledge of Beta instruction formats and
opcode values is built into the bodies of the macro definitions.
The UASM processing is actually quite general &#8212; with a
different set of macro definitions it could process assembly
language programs for almost any ISA!</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide12.png"/></p>

<p>All the macro definitions for the Beta ISA are provided in the
beta.uasm file, which is included in each of the assembly
language lab assignments.  Note that we include some convenience
macros to define shorthand representations that provide common
default values for certain operands.  For example, except for
procedure calls, we don&#700;t care about the PC+4 value saved
in the destination register by branch instructions, so almost
always would specify R31 as the Rc register, effectively
discarding the PC+4 value saved by branches.  So we define
two-argument branch macros that automatically provide R31 as the
destination register.  Saves some typing, and, more importantly,
it makes it easier to understand the assembly language
program.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide13.png"/></p>

<p>Here are a whole set of convenience macros intended to make
programs more readable.  For example, unconditional branches can
be written using the BR() macro rather than the more cumbersome
BEQ(R31,...). And it&#700;s more readable to use branch-false
(BF) and branch-true (BT) macros when testing the results of a
compare instruction.</p>

<p>And note the PUSH and POP macros at the bottom of page.  These
expand into multi-instruction sequences, in this case to add and
remove values from a stack data structure pointed to by the SP
register.</p>

<p>We call these macros <i>pseudo instructions</i> since
they let us provide the programmer with what appears a larger
instruction set, although underneath the covers we&#700;ve just
using the same small instruction repertoire developed in the
lecture on &#8220;Instruction Set Architectures&#8221;.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide14.png"/></p>

<p>In this example we&#700;ve rewritten the original code we had
for the factorial computation using pseudo instructions.  For
example, CMOVE is a pseudo instruction for moving small
constants into a register.  It&#700;s easier for us to read and
understand the intent of a &#8220;constant move&#8221; operation
than an &#8220;add a value to 0&#8221; operation provided by the
ADDC expansion of CMOVE.  Anything we can do to remove the
cognitive clutter will be very beneficial in the long run.</p>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide15.png"/></p>

<p>So far we&#700;ve talked about assembling instructions.  What
about data?  How do we allocate and initialize data storage and
how do we get those values into registers so that they can be
used as operands?</p>

<p>Here we see a program that allocates and initializes two memory
locations using the LONG macro.  We&#700;ve used labels to
remember the addresses of these locations for later
reference.</p>

<p>When the program is assembled the values of the label N and
factN are 0 and 4 respectively, the addresses of the memory
locations holding the two data values.</p>

<p>To access the first data value, the program uses a LD
instruction, in this case one of convenience macros that
supplies R31 as the default value of the Ra field.  The
assembler replaces the reference to the label N with its value 0
from the symbol table. When the LD is executed, it computes the
memory address by adding the constant (0) to the value of the Ra
register (which is R31 and hence the value is 0) to get the
address (0) of the memory location from which to fetch the value
to be placed in R1.</p>

</vertical>
<vertical display_name="UASM Expressions and Layout">
<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide16.png"/></p>

<p>The constants needed as values for data words and instruction
fields can be written as expressions.  These expressions are
evaluated by the assembler as it assembles the program and the
resulting value is used as needed.  Note that the expressions
are evaluated at the time the assembler runs.  By the time the
program runs on the Beta, the resulting value is used.  The
assembler does NOT generate ADD and MUL instructions to compute
the value during program execution.  If a value is needed for an
instruction field or initial data value, the assembler has to be
able to perform the arithmetic itself.  If you need the program
to compute a value during execution, you have to write the
necessary instructions as part of your program.</p>

<p>One last UASM feature: there&#700;s a special symbol
&#8220;.&#8221;, called &#8220;dot&#8221;, whose value is the
address of the next main memory location to be filled by the
assembler when it generates binary data.  Initially
&#8220;.&#8221; is 0 and it&#700;s incremented each time a new
byte value is generated.</p>

<p>We can set the value of &#8220;.&#8221; to tell the assembler
where in memory we wish to place a value.  In this example, the
constant 0xDEADBEEF is placed into location 0x100 of main
memory.  And we can use &#8220;.&#8221; in expressions to
compute the values for other symbols, as shown here when
defining the value for the symbol &#8220;k&#8221;.  In fact, the
label definition &#8220;k:&#8221; is exactly equivalent to the
UASM statement &#8220;k = .&#8221;</p>

<p>We can even increment the value of &#8220;.&#8221; to skip over
locations, <i>e.g.</i>, if we wanted to leave space for an un
initialized array.</p>

<h2>Summary: Assembly Language</h2>

<p align="center"><img style="height:450px;" src="lecture_slides/assembly/Slide17.png"/></p>

<p>And that&#700;s assembly language!  We use assembly language
as a convenient notation for generating the binary encoding for
instructions and data.  We let the assembler build the bit-level
representations we need and to keep track of the addresses where
these values are stored in main memory.</p>

<p>UASM itself provides support for values, symbols, labels and
macros.</p>

<p>Values can be written as constants or expressions involving
constants.</p>

<p>We use symbols to give meaningful names to values so that our
programs will be more readable and more easily modified.
Similarly, we use labels to give meaningful names to addresses
in main memory and then use the labels in referring to data
locations in LD or ST instructions, or to instruction locations
in branch instructions.</p>

<p>Macros hide the details of how instructions are assembled from
their component fields.</p>

<p>And we can use &#8220;.&#8221; to control where the assembler
places values in main memory.</p>

<p>The assembler is itself a program that runs on our computer.
That raises an interesting &#8220;chicken and egg
problem&#8221;: how did the first assembler program get
assembled into binary so it could run on a computer?  Well, it
was hand-assembled into binary.  I suspect it processed a very
simple language indeed, with the bells and whistles of symbols,
labels, macros, expression evaluation, etc. added only after
basic instructions could be assembled by the program.  And
I&#700;m sure they were very careful not loose the binary so
they wouldn&#700;t have to do the hand-assembly a second
time!</p>
